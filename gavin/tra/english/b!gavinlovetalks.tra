@0    = ~<CHARNAME>, you are clearly an intriguing woman. Would you indulge me in a philosophical discussion?~
@1    = ~I suppose. What would you like to talk about?~
@2    = ~I'd like to talk philosophy with you, Gavin, but this is not the best time.~
@3    = ~I have no interest in philosophy, Gavin.~
@4    = ~No offense, Gavin, but I think our opinions are really too different for this to be a meaningful discussion.~
@5    = ~Unless I have completely mistaken your intention, you might do better "seeking the opinion" of one of your own kind.~
@6    = ~That depends. Are you asking me because I am neither fish nor fowl?~
@7    = ~Gavin, I would be happier if you saved your voice for spellcasting. We are travelling companions, and that is as close as I would like to become.~
@8    = ~I beg your pardon, then, but I only desired to get to know you better. If you would rather not, though, I understand.~
@9    = ~I would rather not become more familiar with a human.~
@10   = ~No, that's all right. I may have overreacted. A <PRO_RACE> among humans is a bit of an oddity in these parts.~
@11   = ~Lathander teaches us that all races should live in harmony. Sometimes, though, it is easy to forget that your acceptance of another race does not imply that they will accept you. I shall intrude no further on your privacy.~
@12   = ~Not at all! Lathander teaches us that all races should live in harmony. And while it is easy to forget that your acceptance of another race does not imply that they will accept you, it is refreshing to see that you are willing to overlook our differences for now.~
@13   = ~I would rather not become more familiar with one who can so easily overlook the difficulties one in my situation faces.~
@14   = ~I've long held the opinion that people have two choices in this life. They can act or they can react. This is true regardless of whether or not their actions serve the greater good.~
@15   = ~I, myself, am no doer of great deeds. Instead, I react to the deeds of others. I am not necessarily proud of this lack of ambition, but I know that it is my nature.~
@16   = ~I wondered whether you were more driven by reaction or the need for action.~
@17   = ~I am a doer. When I see an opportunity, I take it. I do not wait for someone else to make the first move.~
@18   = ~I am probably a bit of both. Sometimes, I take initiative, other times, I respond to the deeds of others.~
@19   = ~Like you, I tend to react more than act.~
@20   = ~Gavin, I can tell already that you're an indecisive bleater. I wish you'd grow a backbone.~
@21   = ~I have no idea. I've never thought about it before.~
@22   = ~What an incredibly harsh thing to say. But have no fear. I will not attempt to get to know you any better.~
@23   = ~Then I shall give you time to think about it. I'd like to hear what you have to say, but it can wait.~
@24   = ~In some ways, then, I envy you. You will always have more control over your destiny than someone who takes a more passive approach. There is always the risk that you will cause problems you will have to solve later, but at least you will never wind up sitting there blaming the world for your situation.~
@25   = ~You are damned right, I won't. I will never let anyone dictate my actions.~
@26   = ~That might be taking it a little far. There is always give and take. I try to steer my own fate, but sometimes, everyone has to respond to their environment.~
@27   = ~Why are you asking me this?~
@28   = ~If someone's meddling prevents me from reaching my goals, you can well believe I'll lay blame where it is deserved.~
@29   = ~It's definitely a decisive outlook, but there must be times that you find you have to bend. But I do not want you to feel you have to justify yourself to me. You are assertive, and show common sense. Neither are unattractive qualities.~
@30   = ~You are the master of your own destiny, remember. If you want to take the credit, you must also take the blame.~
@31   = ~That's a remarkably wise attitude. You reap the benefits of both ways of thinking. I admire your drive, but I also admire your common sense.~
@32   = ~If we're going to be travelling together, I thought it might be nice to get to know each other a bit better. You have a compelling personality, so I admit to an interest.~
@33   = ~In that case, then, I am definitely a doer. No one is going to tell me what to do.~
@34   = ~In that case, I have to say there is always some give and take. I try not to let anyone else steer my fate, but there are times when even the most decisive person has to respond to their environment.~
@35   = ~Gavin, rest assured that I have no interest in getting to know you any better.~
@36   = ~Opinion noted.~
@37   = ~That's understandable, but don't you find that limiting, sometimes? I know I always wished I was more decisive, and I have nothing like your talents.~
@38   = ~Well, when you put it like that, I guess I do take control of my own fate sometimes. But I could not say that I always choose to lead, regardless of the circumstances.~
@39   = ~Just like you, I am who I am. I will never be a great leader.~
@40   = ~Gavin, if you are just looking to find fault with me, I want no part in this conversation.~
@41   = ~Gavin, I don't know why you are asking me all these questions, but I have no interest in getting to know you any better.~
@42   = ~I would be inclined to disagree. I think you could well become a great leader. But I have no interest in offending you by forcing my opinions on you! I won't continue, as I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I think you might be selling yourself short.~
@43   = ~Would you prefer not to get to know each other any better at all?~
@44   = ~No, Gavin. I just don't want to talk about philosophy.~
@45   = ~Yes, Gavin. I already know you better than I want to.~
@46   = ~Not exactly, Gavin. I do want to get to know you better, but I suspect this conversation might be a bit uncomfortable, so I'd like to avoid it, if possible.~
@47   = ~Whatever else anyone may say, I have to respect your desire to avoid conflict. I think well of you for that.~
@48   = ~Ah, well. Never mind.~
@49   = ~Maybe later, then.~
@50   = ~While we're talking about personal motivation, how much do you think one person can affect his or her surroundings? Can one man or woman really change the world?~
@51   = ~Of course. Every action we take changes the world, even if it's only a little bit.~
@52   = ~Yes. A lifetime of good works and service to one's cause can leave the world better than it was before.~
@53   = ~I don't know, Gavin. But I am not going to let that stop me from trying.~
@54   = ~Not really. But it passes the time.~
@55   = ~No, Gavin. There is little chance that a farmer in Maztica will ever know or care what we're doing. We are not responsibe for the whole world, just the part we're using.~
@56   = ~Can't we just talk about the weather?~
@57   = ~Gavin, I simply don't care.~
@58   = ~You're a dreamer, but I like the way you dream.~
@59   = ~Rewards for the patient, eh? But I see what you mean. The important thing is the net increase of goodness in the world, not the time it takes to get there.~
@60   = ~That's the spirit. Who knows? With luck and determination, we really might make a difference.~
@61   = ~There are lots of ways to pass the time. But no matter. I can go on hoping that it is possible to change the world, even if it's only in a small way.~
@62   = ~Then I suppose leaving the part we're using better than we found it should be good enough.~
@63   = ~We could, but that would not increase our understanding of it.~
@64   = ~A pity.~
@65   = ~I assure you that I have no intention of finding fault with you, but neither do I want to make you uncomfortable. Would you prefer it if I kept my opinions to myself for the rest of the trip?~
@66   = ~No, Gavin. I just don't want to talk about this any more.~
@67   = ~Stow it, Gavin. I really do not want to get to know you any better.~
@68   = ~Would this be a good time to talk about philosophy, <CHARNAME>?~
@69   = ~No, Gavin. I did not want to talk about it at all. Please drop it.~
@70   = ~Sure, Gavin. Go ahead.~
@71   = ~You should have said am much. I guess it wasn't that important.~
@72   = ~<CHARNAME>, forgive me for distracting you, but I was wondering if I might bend your ear for a while.~
@73   = ~If this is going to be another of your philosophical discussions, then no.~
@74   = ~Certainly.~
@75   = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but this isn't the best time for a chat. Could we put it off until later?~
@76   = ~Gavin, we are companions for the time being, and that is as close as I would like to become.~
@77   = ~"No, not now," or "no, not ever"?~
@78   = ~"No, not ever." Talking about philosophy and personal values gives me a headache.~
@79   = ~"No, not ever." In fact, I would be perfectly content if you kept your opinions to yourself for the rest of the trip.~
@80   = ~"No, not now." I'd like to talk to you, but it isn't a good time.~
@81   = ~I'm sure you noticed that I am a cleric. I chose this path because helping others gives my life a sense of purpose. I wondered whether or not you are driven by a similar need.~
@82   = ~Not really. I do what is right because it is the right thing to do, but I don't lie awake nights worrying about people I could not help.~
@83   = ~Sometimes, but other times, I act the way I do out of habit, as much as anything else.~
@84   = ~You might say that. I never really thought about it, but that does sound like something I would do.~
@85   = ~Without a doubt. Good deeds are meaningless unless they are performed out of a desire to help others.~
@86   = ~With an attitude like that, all the good deeds in the world are meaningless. Do you really feel that way, or did that just come out wrong?~
@87   = ~The result is important, not the motivation. In the end, the good is upheld. If I do what I do for my own reasons, does it matter?~
@88   = ~Gavin, I did not know this was going to turn into an interrogation. If you will pardon me, I must return my attention to leading this party.~
@89   = ~No, that didn't come out quite right. I do worry about the welfare of others, or I wouldn't behave the way I do. I am just saying that I realize that I can't help everyone. In some ways, remembering the people I have helped makes it easier to accept the times when I couldn't.~
@90   = ~It matters to me.~
@91   = ~Then I shall not detain you.~
@92   = ~That's different! In many ways, one cannot help but feel the way you do. There will always be those beyond aid, but that should not make you lose faith.~
@93   = ~So tell me, then, how you feel about the ability of the law to ensure the welfare of the people under it?~
@94   = ~Without law, there is anarchy, and anarchy helps no one.~
@95   = ~Laws exist to make life better for society. I would not like to imagine world without them.~
@96   = ~If everyone would be ruled by their conscience, there would be no need for more formal legislation, but we both know that is unlikely. So yes, we need rules. But I see no point in allowing no exceptions in those cases where a law might be hurtful to another.~
@97   = ~I am not overly fond of regulations. They lead to oppression.~
@98   = ~Well, there are a lot of steps in between authoritarian rule and anarchy, but I asked more out of curiosity than conviction.~
@99   = ~I tend to waffle on that whole issue. I want what is best for everyone, so most of the time, obeying the law is the best way to accomplish this, but there are other times that I think people are entitled to more personal freedom.~
@100  = ~It has never been an easy question for me.~
@101  = ~Neither would I. But I also know that there are bound to be exceptions, instances where the law serves to oppress rather than protect. But I asked more out of curiosity than conviction.~
@102  = ~I know what you mean, and I agree. But I asked more out of curiosity than conviction.~
@103  = ~I suppose there are times that might be true, but I believe that, on the whole, society does need rules. But I asked more out of curiosity than conviction.~
@104  = ~I don't know if that is the most admirable motivation in the world, but I've heard worse. I'd be happier if you felt driven by the need to help others, but I guess I should not be too picky, as long as you are doing the right thing.~
@105  = ~The result is important, not the motivation. In the end, the good is upheld. Does the reason matter?~
@106  = ~It is very reassuring to hear that you act out of a desire to help others, but it is even better to hear that you consider this to be part of your nature.~
@107  = ~If you will indulge me even further, I am curious about your opinion on the ability of the law to protect the rights of its adherants.~
@108  = ~Laws exist to make life better for society. I would not like to imagine a world without them.~
@109  = ~It is very reassuring to hear that you act out of a desire to help others, but it is even better to hear that this is a conscious decision on your part, and one you give considerable thought.~
@110  = ~I see. Then I shall not trouble you again.~
@111  = ~If you wish.~
@112 = ~You know, we've been standing here, talking about good and evil as if they were universally understood entities, but it occurs to me that we might have very different ideas. What does "evil" mean to you?~
@113  = ~If it hurts someone else, it's evil.~
@114  = ~Gavin, it's been a long <DAYNIGHT>. Can we give it a rest?~
@115  = ~Putting selfish desires ahead of the welfare of everyone else.~
@116  = ~Cruelty.~
@117  = ~If I were to stumble and knock you over, I might hurt you. Would that make me evil?~
@118  = ~Yes, I know, I would not have done it intentionally, nor would I have taken pleasure in your pain. Evil is wilfully pursuing selfish ends despite the damage it does to others.~
@119  = ~But I have been selfish, myself, and taken much of your time. And subjected you to a sermon, no less. Forgive me. Let us catch up.~
@120  = ~Yes, of course. I apologize for being so long-winded.~
@121  = ~Yes, you are right. But you should probably make a distinction between selfish whim and self-preservation. If we were to find ourselves surrounded and outnumbered, I would not feel pangs of remorse about putting the needs of the few, which would be us, ahead of the many.~
@122  = ~Without a doubt, but there is more to it than that. Cruelty is taking pleasure in another's pain.~
@123  = ~Evil is wilfully pursuing selfish ends despite the damage it does to others.~
@124  = ~Is this a better time for a chat, <CHARNAME>?~
@125  = ~No, Gavin. I have a feeling this is going to be another philosophical debate, and I have no interest in it. Please drop it.~
@126  = ~You might have said you did not wish to talk about it.~
@127  = ~<CHARNAME>, what was your childhood like? If you don't mind talking about it, that is.~
@128  = ~You already know I was raised by my foster father, Gorion. He was always an important part of my life.~
@129  = ~You already know I was raised by my foster father, Gorion. Our relationship was never close, though.~
@130  = ~I was raised by my foster father, Gorion. He was always an important part of my life.~
@131  = ~I was raised by my foster father, Gorion. Our relationship was never close, though.~
@132  = ~There isn't much to tell. I grew up in Candlekeep. It was a fascinating place to grow up, with all the books, and all the distinguished visitors. I swear I saw Khelben Blackstaff himself, once, although I was too young to really remember it.~
@133  = ~There isn't much to tell. I grew up in Candlekeep. I cannot imagine a more boring place. Nothing but dusty books and boring old men.~
@134  = ~Gavin, I don't really want to talk about my childhood. I find your interest in my personal life disturbing.~
@135  = ~This isn't the best time for reminiscences.~
@136  = ~But I do mind talking about it. My childhood was dreadful and I am deeply scarred by it. I have no wish to relive the nightmare.~
@137  = ~Gavin, I have no wish to become closer to each other than travelling companions.~
@138  = ~It's nice to hear that you can remember your childhood so fondly, and I am sure your respect for Gorion was well deserved. I have not heard much about him, but what I have heard has been good. He seems to have been well regarded in the intellectual community, not that I would know from personal experience, however. No one ever accused me of being a great thinker.~
@139  = ~But I was also curious about your day to day life. I grew up in a much more humble environment, with lots of companions my own age and all the distractions that might amuse a young boy. Candlekeep does not seem like a place that would be crawling with playmates.~
@140  = ~No, it wasn't but I did have Imoen. She was like a sister to me.~
@141  = ~No, it was not, but people were kind. I got lessons from the best teachers, when I wanted them or could be made to sit still long enough. Some of the monks and scholars always had time for a chat, especially old Firebead and Tethtoril and Phlydia. And there were plenty of friendly townsfolk around, like Dreppin the cowherd, and old Winthrop. Jondalar and some of the guards treated me well, too. I had no shortage of friends, even if they were older than me.~
@142  = ~The only company I really needed were the books.~
@143  = ~That's good. It doesn't sound like you were as lonely as many only children. How did the learned population of Candlekeep react to having a child around?~
@144  = ~People were kind, mostly. I got lessons from the best teachers, when I wanted them or could be made to sit still long enough. Some of the monks and scholars always had time for a chat, especially old Firebead and Tethtoril and Phlydia. And there were plenty of friendly townsfolk around, like Dreppin the cowherd, and old Winthrop. Jondalar and some of the guards treated me well, too. I had no shortage of friends, even if they were older than me.~
@145  = ~They didn't seem to mind too much. As long as you didn't do anything too ridiculous, like playing a horn in the library, everyone was nice enough.~
@146  = ~That's really about all I wanted to say about growing up in Candlekeep.~
@147  = ~It sounds like you weren't as lonely as many only children would have been. Did you have any friends your own age?~
@148  = ~Well, there was Imoen, who's like a sister, really.~
@149  = ~Well, there was Imoen, of course, but she was a bit of a brat.~
@150  = ~It does sound like a good place to grow up. Thank you for sharing that part of your past with me.~
@151  = ~Ha! I can see why that would be a problem. It does sound like a good place to grow up. Thank you for sharing that part of your past with me.~
@152  = ~Well, at least you had Imoen. Thanks for sharing that part of your past with me.~
@153  = ~That's a shame. But thanks for sharing that part of your past with me.~
@154  = ~Thanks for sharing that part of your past with me.~
@155  = ~I'm sorry to hear that you and he were never close. As an only child, the lack of other family must have bothered you.~
@156  = ~I am a bit surprised you found growing up with Gorion to be so unpleasant, though. I have not heard much about him, but what I have heard has been good. He seems to have been well regarded in the intellectual community, not that I would know from personal experience, however. No one ever accused me of being a great thinker.~
@157  = ~Candlekeep was horrible. Gorion was distant, all the other adults were aloof and uncaring, Imoen was a brat, and everyone made me feel like an outcast. I hated it, and am glad to finally be free of it.~
@158  = ~I'm too scarred by the experience to even want to talk about it.~
@159  = ~I'm sorry to hear your childhood was such a nightmare. Hopefully, time and experience will eventually help you put it in perspective and move on.~
@160  = ~"Time and experience," my left ear! You really have no idea how horrible it was. Maybe if you came down off your pedestal, you might be able to see how misunderstood I was.~
@161  = ~Maybe. I don't know, Gavin. I've only been on my own a few weeks. We'll see how I feel about it later.~
@162  = ~I'm sorry if you perceive my interest in your well-being as an attack. I am also sorry your childhood had such a lingering and detrimental effect on your outlook. I regret bringing it up.~
@163  = ~That's the spirit! I'm sorry I stirred up unpleasant memories, but you are right. It is still too soon to expect you to just accept the past without resentment.~
@164  = ~That does sound appealing. I did not learn to read myself until I was nearly grown, but I can well understand your fondness for it.~
@165  = ~But I was also curious about your day to day life. Was your relationship with Gorion close? I grew up in a much more humble environment, with lots of companions my own age and all the distractions that might amuse a young boy. Candlekeep does not seem like a place that would be crawling with playmates.~
@166  = ~Gorion was a loving parent to me. He was always a big part of my life. And I did have Imoen. She was like a sister to me.~
@167  = ~Gorion was a distant figure to me. I hardly knew he was there. But I did have Imoen. She was like a sister to me.~

@170  = ~Well, that's something, at least. I suppose it's better than no family at all. How did the learned population of Candlekeep react to having a child around?~
@171  = ~It is unfortunate that you were not closer, but sometimes children do not bond to even their natural parents. At least it sounds like you weren't as lonely as many children would have been in your circumstances. Did you have any friends your own age?~
@172  = ~But I was also curious about your day to day life. What of your family and friends?

@180  = ~Would you rather I didn't speak at all?~
@181  = ~Yes. I need a cleric, nothing more.~
@182  = ~Yes, Gavin. Save your voice for spellcasting. I've heard entirely too much from you.~
@183  = ~No, Gavin, I don't know if you need to go that far, but I really do not want to about my family, my childhood, or anything really personal right now.~

Della, who is only a little older than me, helps him, but she always had a head for numbers, so she also keeps the books. My younger brother Jolun is an artist. My sister Reed is a mage. She is the one who gave me my ring.~
@201  = ~Yes, you told me about Reed's ring. I don't know why you don't just have the enchantment removed so you can at least take it off.~
@202  = ~Yes, you told me about Reed's ring. What a great prank. It sounds like something Imoen would have done. Good thing she isn't a mage.~
@203  = ~Yes, you told me about Reed's ring. What a great prank.~
@204  = ~I've noticed your ring. Is there a story behind it, or did she just give it to you?~
@205  = ~Thanks for the information about your family, and thanks for keeping it short. I was afraid this would turn into another endless discussion.~
@206  = ~It must have been nice to grow up as part of such a big family.~
@207  = ~No wonder you're so nosy. With all those people living under one roof, you must think someone is a stranger if she doesn't want to reveal every minute detail of her life to you.~
@208  = ~I never wanted to take it off. I like the ring, but I am also fond of Reed. I admire her intelligence, and I like her sense of humor. The ring is a reminder of both, so it doesn't bother me if it won't come off.~
@209  = ~Yes, it does sound like Imoen, and it's probably just as well that a prankster like her does not have access to Reed's magic. Once, when I was home for a visit in between assignments, she put a glyph on the biscuit barrel, so when I raided it in the middle of the night, it started shrieking. It woke up everyone in the house!~
@210  = ~I adore her, though. I admire her intelligence, and appreciate her sense of humor. The ring is a reminder of both, so I wouldn't take it off if I could.~
@211  = ~In some ways, you remind me of her. Well, not in a sisterly kind of way, but I admire your humor and your wit.~
@212  = ~Reed is really quite the joker, and she knows I don't mind. Once, when I was home for a visit in between assignments, she put a glyph on the biscuit barrel, so when I raided it in the middle of the night, it started shrieking. It woke up everyone in the house!~
@213  = ~There is indeed a story behind it. It used to belong to a great uncle, a powerful mage who lived in Baldur's Gate, I think. He died when I was fairly young, about the same time Reed was starting to study magic. He was very pleased with her choice, so he left her most of his possessions to help her on her way.~
@214  = ~Reed knew I always liked the ring, so when I was ordained a priest she gave it to me. I was thrilled, of course, but I was even happier when I found out about her little addition. She placed an enchantment on the ring so I couldn't take it off.~
@215  = ~Yes, Reed is really quite the joker, and she knows I don't mind. Once, when I was home for a visit in between assignments, she put a glyph on the biscuit barrel, so when I raided it in the middle of the night, it started shrieking. It woke up everyone in the house!~
@216  = ~Is speaking with me so unpleasant? I could stop if you wished.~
@217  = ~No, I don't want you to stop talking to me. But I think we've discussed our families enough.~
@218  = ~No, I don't want you to stop talking to me. But I have a bit of a headache. I'm all right, but it is distracting.~
@219  = ~Please do. I grow weary of your babbling.~
@220  = ~It might be best if we limited our talk to matters related to our quest.~
@221  = ~Very well. We'll consider that subject closed.~
@222  = ~You should have said! I'm a cleric. I'm supposed to be able to do something for that. Let me make you some willow-bark tea. That should help.~
@223  = ~Then I shall make sure you don't have to endure it any longer.~
@224  = ~It is, right up to the point where you're expected to remember everyone's birthday. I always mix up Jolun and Gordon. Fortunately, neither really cares.~
@225  = ~It is, but I find that I am closest to Jolun and Reed.~
@226  = ~You would probably like Reed. She is the one who gave me this ring. There is a story behind it. It used to belong to a great uncle, a powerful mage who lived in Baldur's Gate, I think. He died when I was fairly young, about the same Reed was starting to study magic. He was very pleased with her choice, so he left her most of his possessions to help her on her way.~
@227  = ~No matter how I interpret what you just said, it still sounds offensive. It's probably an overreaction on my part, though.~
@228  = ~Probably not. I am pretty tired of your preoccupation with my personal life.~
@229  = ~No, I'm just irritable. But you do seem quite interested in my personal life~
@230  = ~Can't you take a joke?~
@231  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. I spoke without thinking.~
@232  = ~I am interested in your personal life because you are a fascinating woman. Even so, your words sting. I value your affection, but I am not an insensitive man.~
@233  = ~I can, but that was more of an attack. I am interested in your personal life because you are a fascinating woman. Even so, your words sting. I value your affection, but I am not an insensitive man.~
@234  = ~And I listened without steeling myself. I am interested in your personal life because you are a fascinating woman. Even so, your words sting. I value your affection, but I am not an insensitive man.~
@235  = ~I shall not trouble you again.~
@236  = ~But I didn't start this conversation to bore you with tales of my childhood.~
@237  = ~You really haven't told me much of your childhood at all. What was it like, growing up as a sailmaker's son in Ulgoth's Beard?~
@238  = ~*wink* You're forgiven, but don't let it happen again.~
@239  = ~Too late.~
@240  = ~You haven't really told me much about what influenced you most as a boy.~
@241  = ~What was it like, being part of such a large family?~
@242  = ~*smiles and brushes a loose strand of hair out of your eyes* Shall we catch up with the others, then?~
@243  = ~I apologize. I do ramble on, sometimes.~
@244  = ~It's easy to forget that for someone raised in Candlekeep, the ordinary must seem strange. My family was large, even by local standards. But my father had a good business, and we were comfortable enough. Gordon is quite a bit older than me, so we aren't particularly close. Della and I are close in age, if not in temperament. She was always a bit too studious to go romping through forest and field with an overactive boy bent on getting as messy as possible.~
@245  = ~You? A messy child? I find that hard to believe.~
@246  = ~Sounds like fun to me. Playing outside, or anywhere else, was discouraged at Candlekeep.~
@247  = ~So what was your favorite game?~
@248  = ~Did you have a lot of playmates?~
@249  = ~Oh, it's true. I spent most of the first twelve years of my life with muddy knees and grass in my hair. But the temple cured me of that. They're kind, but there is some discipline. I used to think that old Cresden, the novice master when I joined, was a frustrated Helmite, the way he insisted on neat hair and clean clothing.~
@250  = ~But before that, my brother Jolun and I used to be feared throughout the North, or so we imagined.~
@251  = ~What was your favorite game?~
@252  = ~Did you have a lot of playmates besides Jolun?~
@253  = ~So, when did you become so... sedate?~
@254  = ~A fair few, but Jolun and I were inseparable. He tried to understand why I had to leave Ulgoth's Beard to learn to become a priest, but if he ever did, it took years. He blamed himself, I guess, although he shouldn't have. If he hadn't cut his leg and I hadn't healed it, it would have been something else.~
@255  = ~Time has repaired our friendship. If he never understood why I had to go, at least he has forgiven me for it. He is still a wild one, though. He left to find his fortune in Waterdeep shortly after I was ordained, but we write to each other, and try to make sure our visits to our parents coincide.~
@256  = ~He's always trying to coax me into mischief, though.~
@257  = ~Sounds like Jolun has a healthy attitude. When did you become so serious?~
@258  = ~What kind of mischief?~
@259  = ~Did you and Jolun fight much?~
@260  = ~Thanks for telling me about your childhood.~
@261  = ~It started when I realized that I could save a life, or take one. That was a sobering realization. Lathander gives me the ability, but I direct its use. I need to do so responsibly.~
@262  = ~You do.~
@263  = ~Does that mean you have to be serious all the time?~
@264  = ~If you ask me, I think Jolun has the better attitude.~
@265  = ~Is this going to turn into a lecture about responsibility?~
@266  = ~All I can do is try. I am glad you think that I am succeeding. Of course, that does not mean that I am not allowed to enjoy life! I just need to use moderation.~
@267  = ~But there is time enough for talking. Thank you for listening.~
@268  = ~Of course not. I am certainly allowed to enjoy life. I just need to exercise moderation.~
@269  = ~He might. But he does not wield divine magic. Regardless, I am certainly allowed to enjoy life. I just need to exercise moderation.~
@270  = ~No, I've said all I need to about it. Forgive me for leading you to opinion that a lecture is on the way every time I open my mouth.~
@271  = ~Mostly imaginary mischief, to tell you the truth. Jolun still seems to think that it's extremely clever to fortify youself with a few ales and talk about exploits that will never happen, like the time we decided it would be great fun to take down all the street signs in Baldur's Gate so everyone would get lost.~
@272  = ~Fortunately, by then, he was pretty far gone, so convincing him that we should do it in the morning was easy.~
@273  = ~I've learned to be more serious, though. I have the ability to save a life, or take one. That was a sobering realization. Lathander gives me the ability, but I direct its use. I need to do so responsibly.~
@274  = ~Between ourselves, certainly. All boys do. While I was older and stronger than Jolun, he was always more reckless. It gave him an advantage, because he would use tactics that I never would.~
@275  = ~He is still a bit of a firebrand, to tell the truth. I've had to become more serious. It started when I realized that I could save a life, or take one. That was a sobering realization. Lathander gives me the ability, but I direct its use. I need to do so responsibly.~
@276  = ~Thank you for listening.~
@277  = ~Sedate? Well, I suppose I was never as reckless as Jolun, but few are. He and I were inseparable, even so. He tried to understand why I had to leave Ulgoth's Beard to learn to become a priest, but if he ever did, it took years. He blamed himself, I guess, although he shouldn't have. If he hadn't cut his leg and I hadn't healed it, it would have been something else.~
@278  = ~What a pity. Still, is suppose it's understandable, since Candlekeep must have been a very serious place. I spent most of the first twelve years of my life with muddy knees and grass in my hair. But the temple cured me of that. They're kind, but there is some discipline. I used to think that old Cresden, the novice master when I joined, was a frustrated Helmite, the way he insisted on neat hair and clean clothing.~
@279  = ~Jolun and I would pretend to be adventurers. We would wander all over, getting extremely dirty in the process. We were feared throughout the North, or so we imagined.~
@280  = ~My family, probably. My family was large, even by local standards. But my father had a good business, and we were comfortable enough. Gordon is quite a bit older than me, so we aren't particularly close. Della and I are close in age, if not in temperament. She was always a bit too studious to go romping through forest and field with an overactive boy bent on getting as messy as possible. Not at all like Jolun.~
@281  = ~Chaotic, for the most part. My family was large, even by local standards. But my father had a good business, and we were comfortable enough. Gordon is quite a bit older than me, so we aren't particularly close. Della and I are close in age, if not in temperament. She was always a bit too studious to go romping through forest and field with an overactive boy bent on getting as messy as possible. Not at all like Jolun.~
@282  = ~You should have said that earlier.~
@283  = ~* Camp is set, you have eaten and cleaned up, and you are relaxing for a while before retiring. As usual, Gavin is drawing in his sketchbook. *~
@284  = ~* You leave him alone. *~
@285  = ~* You wander over to see what he is drawing. *~
@286  = ~* As if sensing your attention, Gavin glances up from his sketchbook. Seeing you, he smiles distractedly. *~
@287  = ~Yes?~
@288  = ~No, it was nothing. I was staring into space and my face just happened to be pointing in your direction.~
@289  = ~Has the fire been banked down?~
@290  = ~What are you drawing?~
@291  = ~Oh. Well, let me know if you need anything.~
@292  = ~It looks like we're going to be awake a little while longer. I thought I would let it burn down a bit more. But I will see to it before going to sleep.~
@293  = ~There are some very pretty flowers over here. Would you like to see?~
@294  = ~No, I'm too tired. Just remember to bank down the fire before you fall asleep.~
@295  = ~* You rise and approach him from behind so as not to tread on his subjects by mistake. *~
@296  = ~* Gavin notices your direction of movement and looks up at you. He smiles distractedly. *~
@297  = ~Please be careful where you walk. There are some lovely flowers over here, and the drawing isn't done yet.~
@298  = ~Never mind. I would not want to distract such an avid artist.~
@299  = ~How is it coming along?~
@300  = ~Ah. Well, let me know if you need anything.~
@301  = ~Not bad, though I say it myself. What a pity I have no way to capture their color. Would you like to see?~
@302  = ~* You approach him from behind so as not to tread on his subjects by mistake. *~
@303  = ~* You take the sketchbook from him, but before looking at it, you glance at the flowers for comparison. Although the sketch is clearly not finished, it is quite good. Gavin has accurately captured the shape and proportion of the lilac colored blossoms, and has begun work on the shading.~
@304  = ~This is quite good, Gavin. Who would have thought a cleric would have such an eye for natural beauty? *You hand the sketchbook back.*~
@305  = ~This is quite good, Gavin. Who would have thought a cleric would have such an eye for natural beauty? Do you mind if I look at the rest of the sketches?~
@306  = ~Very nice, Gavin. *You hand the sketchbook back.*~
@307  = ~Very nice, Gavin. Do you mind if I look at the rest of the sketches?~
@308  = ~Hmmm. Very sentimental of you Gavin. I did not know you had a poetic soul. *You hand the sketchbook back.*~
@309  = ~Hmmm. Very sentimental of you Gavin. I did not know you had a poetic soul. Do you mind if I look at the rest of the sketches?~
@310  = ~What rot! Shouldn't you be pounding the dents out of your armor or something? *You hand the sketchbook back.*~
@311  = ~*grins* Shhh! Don't say that so loud! Everyone will want one.~
@312  = ~*grins* Shhh! Don't say that so loud! Everyone will want one. But go ahead and look, if you like.~
@313  = ~*You intend to politely flip through the pages, but find yourself examining them more closely than you intended. Many contain sketches of details of previous resting places - a tree, or a rock formation, or a few flowers - but most are portraits of yourself and your companions. These seem to draw your attention the most.*~
@314  = ~*Sometimes, the subjects are engaged in various break-time activities: setting up camp, or cooking dinner, or studying spells. Mostly, though, Gavin seems to have concentrated on the facial expressions of his subjects. With a few strokes, he has captured looks ranging from peaceful contentment to obviously studious contemplation, to irritation or even sleep.*~
@315  = ~*You find that you are the subject of many of his more detailed sketches. He seems to have taken particular care in drawing them, but you suspect he might have taken a few artistic liberties. You do not remember ever looking quite this good, especially at the end of a long day.*~
@316  = ~Hmmm. Not sure what to make of some of this. Your sketches are very nice. You seem to have a talent for people.~
@317  = ~Hmmm. Not sure what to make of some of this. Thank you for letting me look.~
@318  = ~*You hand the book back with a smile.* Your sketches are very nice, but I think you might have exaggerated a bit on some of them.~
@319  = ~*You hand the book back with a smile.* Your sketches are very nice, Gavin. Thank you for letting me see them.~
@320  = ~Gavin, I notice that you have drawn many sketches of me. You know we're just friends, right?~
@321  = ~*frowning* Thank you for letting me see them.~
@322  = ~*playfully* You might want to stick to flowers.~
@323  = ~*sternly* You might want to stick to flowers.~
@324  = ~Thanks! I'll draw whatever you put in front of me, but I like drawing... people.~
@325  = ~You're welcome. I'll draw whatever you put in front of me, but I like drawing... people.~
@326  = ~Thank you for the compliment, but I just draw what I see.~
@327  = ~Thank you for the compliment!~
@328  = ~Yes... of course. I did not... mean to imply otherwise, but you are... a fascinating subject for a frustrated portrait artist.~
@329  = ~You're welcome. I'll draw whatever you put in front of me, but I like drawing... people. Maybe I should ask if they object first, though.~
@330  = ~Hmmmf! Everybody's a critic.~
@331  = ~Everybody's a critic.~
@332  = ~Thanks!~
@333  = ~Thanks! Be my guest.~
@334  = ~Thanks, I think.~
@335  = ~*cryptic smile* Thanks, I think. Be my guest.~
@336  = ~Ah, well. Everybody's a critic.~
@337  = ~*You wake and take a moment or two to collect yourself before rising. You look around the campsite, and most of your companions are either still asleep or look just as groggy as you feel. But Gavin is already busy, building up the fire and starting to fix breakfast.~
@338  = ~Good morn... evening, Gavin. I may never get used to sleeping while it is light out.~
@339  = ~Did you sleep at all? I don't think it was your turn to watch.~
@340  = ~What's for breakfast?~
@341  = ~"Good morning" is always appropriate! I never saw much sense in wishing someone a good time of day if it was already nearly over. But I know what you mean. I might have slept for a bit, but after 17 years of rising before dawn to worship the rising sun, my habits are pretty fixed.~
@342  = ~There is some tea ready. Those flowers we were looking at last night are more than just pretty. They make a very pleasant infusion.~
@343  = ~So much for your poetic soul. Trust you, Gavin, to pluck something that lovely and turn it into a breakfast beverage.~
@344  = ~Beautiful, and useful, too! What a wonderful combination of attributes.~
@345  = ~I'd drink poison if it woke me up. Slosh some of that in this cup, will you?~
@346  = ~There is a great deal of poetry in a good cup of tea. Try some.~
@347  = ~But I left most of the flowers alone. Their flavor can be overpowering if too much is used, and it would have been a pity to waste more than was necessary. They really are quite lovely.~
@348  = ~Not bad! So, what else are these flowers good for?~
@349  = ~It's all right. But what has you waxing lyrical?~
@350  = ~I suppose I can choke it down, if it wakes me up. What's for breakfast?~
@351  = ~Why this sudden fascination with beauty?~
@352  = ~Just looking pretty and making tea, as far as I know, but they have a couple different symbolic associations.~
@353  = ~Gavin, you go from poetry to botany to esoteric meanings in a handful of sentences, and I'm not even awake yet. Talk slower, and I'll try to follow.~
@354  = ~Oh? Please elaborate.~
@355  = ~Gavin, I had no idea you were interested in that sort of thing.~
@356  = ~Oh, no. No more philosophy, please.~
@357  = ~My only interest at the moment is the contents of that frying pan. What's for breakfast?~
@358  = ~Here along the Sword Coast, they herald a stretch of warmer weather. The elves, however, give them a more ambiguous meaning. You see, the blossoms open every morning, and close every day at sunset. To them, they represent the transience of... attraction, but also the renewal of hope. They are fragile, but they grow back quickly, no matter how incautiously harvested.~
@359  = ~That's encouraging.~
@360  = ~All that, from a flower?~
@361  = ~Now I feel funny drinking something of such cultural importance.~
@362  = ~When did you become an expert in comparative botanical symbolism?~
@363  = ~What do you think?~
@364  = ~Is it? I appreciate the symbolism, and think it fitting, but now, I'm not entirely sure I follow you. Anyway, your breakfast is ready. There is porridge, but I also fried up some mushrooms. If you act quickly, you can have the first portion.~
@365  = ~Well, you have to admire the verbal economy of a plant that can say all that with five petals, but I'm not going to comment on what it's saying.~
@366  = ~I appreciate the symbolism, anyway, and think it fitting. Anyway, your breakfast is ready. There is porridge, but I also fried up some mushrooms. If you act quickly, you can have the first portion.~
@367  = ~More symbolism than importance, really, but you don't have to think about it to enjoy the tea. And you have to admire the verbal economy of a plant that can say all that with five petals.~
@368  = ~Anyway, your breakfast is ready. There is porridge, but I also fried up some mushrooms. If you act quickly, you can have the first portion.~
@369  = ~About the same time I decided to take up juggling flaming torches. That would be "never," in case you haven't read my autobiography. In any case, I like reading about different races. I think understanding might bring them closer together. I can't change the world, but I can improve my own understanding.~
@370  = ~I think I'll have some more tea.~
@371  = ~As I suspect that is not the answer you wanted, I can only admit that I am a man who thinks about such things enough without prompting from a plant, lovely though it is.~
@372  = ~A man has to be interested in something. Even the clerics of Lathander do not work all the time. If you are curious, though, the plant means different things to different races.~
@373  = ~Here along the Sword Coast, the flowers herald a stretch of warmer weather. The elves, however, give them a more ambiguous meaning. You see, the blossoms open every morning, and close every day at sunset. To them, they represent the transience of... attraction, but also the renewal of hope. They are fragile, but they grow back quickly, no matter how incautiously harvested.~
@374  = ~*laughs* Very well. If you are more intersted in breakfast, there is porridge, but I also fried some mushrooms. If you act quickly, you can have the first portion.~
@375  = ~We're alive, the weather is mild, you're here, the usual.~
@376  = ~Oh, and I also have tea. That's always a reason for poetry. But these flowers are good for more than just looking pretty and making tea. They have a couple different symbolic associations.~
@377  = ~When I see loveliness all around me, it becomes hard to ignore its presence.~
@378  = ~Oh, and I also have tea, which is beautiful in itself. But these flowers are good for more than just looking pretty and making tea. They have a couple different symbolic associations.~
@379  = ~Which reminds me of something, but never mind. Try some.~
@380  = ~Hopefully, it won't come to that. Try some.~
@381  = ~I might have slept for a bit, but after 17 years of rising before dawn to worship the rising sun, my habits are pretty fixed.~
@382  = ~There is porridge, but I also fried up some mushrooms. If you act quickly, you can have the first portion.~
@383  = ~I know we've already discussed your reasons for travelling, but I was wondering if there was anything particular you were hoping to find along the way.~
@384  = ~No.~
@385  = ~This isn't the best time for this, Gavin.~
@386  = ~I'm looking for adventure.~
@387  = ~I don't know. Experience, I guess. Candlekeep was rather isolated, and I enjoy the opportunity to see more of the world.~
@388  = ~Fame! "<CHARNAME>, the Bold, Faerun's Greatest Adventurer" has a nice ring to it, don't you think?~
@389  = ~Wealth, my dear Gavin. Why, this time next year, I could be rolling in gold.~
@390  = ~I'm just trying to make the world a better place, Gavin. That's enough for me.~
@391  = ~I serve the cause of justice and righeousness, as any paladin should.~
@392  = ~Poetry, beauty, and song, Gavin. I wish to see the splendors that Faerun has to offer.~
@393  = ~Gavin, we are comrades and travelling companions, but I think we know each other as well as is required.~
@394  = ~You don't say much, do you? No matter. I probably talk enough for us both.~
@395  = ~It bothers me that you never want to talk, but so be it.~
@396  = ~You are likely to find what you're looking for, in that case. We seem to have no shortage of it. But that is one motivation we do not share. Not that it matters, really. I have pledged my faith and my hammer to your cause.~
@397  = ~Your ambition intrigues me, though. It seems I have little of my own. Why do you strive so to succeed?~
@398  = ~Because I do not want to fade into anonymity.~
@399  = ~I just like the thrills.~
@400  = ~My thirst for adventure is real, but it is also useful. I think we're doing some good in this world, and if a bit of wanderlust helps it along, so be it.~
@401  = ~Bored now.~
@402  = ~We all will, dear <CHARNAME>. Even if we achieve the highest renown and everyone knows our names, after we are gone, they will forget those things that made us who we are. But if you are in it for the thrill of travel, you are still likely to be satisfied.~
@403  = ~I had not thought you so mercurial.~
@404  = ~That is the best reason I have ever heard for doing something that might otherwise be viewed as irresponsible.~
@405  = ~Then I am sorry I have offended you.~
@406  = ~You are likely to find what you're looking for, in that case. We seem to have no shortage of it. And I suppose it is one more thing we have in common. Even were it not the case, however, I have pledged my faith and my hammer to your cause.~
@407  = ~My thirst for knowledge is real, but it is also useful. I think we're doing some good in this world, and if a bit of ambition helps it along, so be it.~
@408  = ~Well I hope you get your wish. If nothing else, we're nowhere near there yet, so fulfilling it will mean that you stay alive that long. But the desire for fame is one motivation we do not share. Not that it matters, really. I have already pledged my faith and my hammer to your cause.~
@409  = ~Besides, I like the thrills.~
@410  = ~My thirst for recognition is real, but it is also useful. I think we're doing some good in this world, and if a bit of ambition helps it along, so be it.~
@411  = ~You put your life at risk for coin? I must admit that part of the reason I joined you was that I needed to raise some money, but I had not thought you so mercenary.~
@412  = ~I have to think of my future you know. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life trudging along with company like this simply because I do not have enough gold to stop.~
@413  = ~It isn't only the gold, Gavin, but wealth is a convenient way to keep score.~
@414  = ~So why are you  so desparate for gold?~
@415  = ~I have a relative with the potential to become a great scholar. The temple is by no means miserly toward its clerics, but a quality education is too expensive for my contribution to be meaningful unless I take a few risks.~
@416  = ~Your relative is lucky to have such a generous patron.~
@417  = ~It must be a very important relative for you to risk this much for an education.~
@418  = ~Thank you for saying that.~
@419  = ~That's what family is for.~
@420  = ~I begin to regret offering my services so unconditionally. If greed alone motivates you, I have no doubt that our ways will part.~
@421  = ~I was not aware that it was a game.~
@422  = ~And that is the best reason possible.~
@423  = ~A noble cause.~
@424  = ~How wonderful! But I hope you keep your head.~
@425  = ~We should probably catch up.~
@426  = ~Not so fast, Gavin. It's only fair for you to tell me of *your* motives. Is there something you are looking for?~
@427  = ~I still think your interest in my motivation is a little unsettling.~
@428  = ~You are right. We should catch up.~
@429  = ~Lead on, and I shall follow. It is my place, and I enjoy the view.~
@430  = ~I ask because you are a fascinating woman. Say the word, and I shall curb my interest.~
@431  = ~No, Gavin. I don't want you to stop. It just takes some time to get used to.~
@432  = ~Consider the word said. I do not welcome the attention.~
@433  = ~There's no rush.~
@434  = ~I am an uncomplicated man. I am doing this for my family, in a way. I have a young relative with great potential, but whose mother is unable to provide her with the education to refine it. I follow you, in particular, because your cause is worthwhile. I am interested in your... friendship because you are a good leader and a fascinating woman.~
@435  = ~Fair enough.~
@436  = ~There is more to it than that, Gavin. A man does not suddenly decide to abandon the life he knew and loved and take up adventuring to send a child to school or on the off chance of meeting interesting people.~
@437  = ~Sometimes, I think that you and I do not always agree, even when it comes to my cause. Is there something else I should know about?~
@438  = ~Gavin, you might find me interesting, but I find you perplexing. You claim simplicity, but you speak of your motivations in only the vaguest terms. And you guard your past like a maiden's virtue.~
@439  = ~Gavin, you might find me interesting, but I find you vexing. I don't mean to be rude, but your interest in me borders on the unhealthy.~
@440  = ~I am sorry you feel that way. I shall bother you no more.~
@441  = ~We have talked about my past, remember?~
@442  = ~Yes, of course. My mistake.~
@443  = ~Oh, now I remember. I was a bit distracted, then, or not listening closely enough.~
@444  = ~We did talk about your past. Right up until your ordination. You must have been doing something in all the time since. How many years was it?~
@445  = ~Now that's settled, so let us catch up with the others.~
@446  = ~*smiling more widely* Then, whose fault was that? Come on, now. If you were not listening before, why should I repeat something so boring. Let us catch up.~
@447  = ~Nine years. I was serving the temple, in various capacities, from running errands to working in the fields, to helping the faithful...~
@448  = ~*sighs* Yes, <CHARNAME>, there is more. There is always more. But I'm not ready to talk about it, yet.~
@449  = ~That's all right, Gavin. Tell me when you are ready.~
@450  = ~You have been keeping secrets, Gavin? This will not do at all! Your unwillingness to talk about it is suspicious.~
@451  = ~Then forget it. It doesn't matter anyway.~
@452  = ~Thank you for the kindness.~
@453  = ~If I am unwilling to talk about it, it is because it is still a painful memory. I am not trying to hide anything from you, if that is what worries you. If you command it, I will have no choice but to tell you, but I would prefer to wait until the time is right.~
@454  = ~I don't want to make you uncomfortable, Gavin, but I need to ensure the security of this group. As long as your secret does not jeapardize our safety, you may use your discretion, but if this is dangerous knowledge, I must know.~
@455  = ~I would not force you to reveal anything before you are ready.~
@456  = ~Out with it, Gavin.~
@457  = ~Is all this drama really necessary?~
@458  = ~No, it isn't. Let's just let it drop.~
@459  = ~Very well, since you insist. I am trying to find my way after a failed relationship. It ended badly, and it is still painful for me to speak of it. I had not told you, because I did not wish to burden you with my troubles.~
@460  = ~If your curiosity is satisfied, I would prefer to say no more of it now.~
@461  = ~There is no need to get defensive about it.~
@462  = ~Oh. I'm sorry I pushed you so hard, Gavin. I can see why you did not want to talk about it yet.~
@463  = ~Whatever. Just don't let it interfere with your duties.~
@464  = ~It will not. If you will excuse me, I will refrain from discussing anything personal with you in the future, as well.~
@465  = ~That's all right. You have a lot on your mind, and I know you have to make sure everyone in the group is focused. If you don't mind, I would like to postpone further discussion on that subject for a while. Too much drama for one <DAYNIGHT>. Besides, we've fallen behind.~
@466  = ~I'm sorry. I don't mean to snap at you. But that's why I was reluctant to talk about it. I knew I must tell you sooner or later, but I was still unprepared. This is way too much drama for one <DAYNIGHT>. If you don't mind, I would like to catch up with the others.~
@467  = ~May Lathander and all good gods bless you for your mercy. I know I've got to talk about it sooner or later, but I am not prepared right now. But enough drama for one <DAYNIGHT>. Let's catch up.~
@468  = ~Let me assure you that the matter is nothing that would endanger the safety or the welfare of the group in any way. I know I've got to talk about it sooner or later, but I am not prepared right now. But that is more than enough drama for one <DAYNIGHT>. Let's catch up.~
@469  = ~May Lathander bless you. I know I've got to talk about it sooner or later, but I am not prepared right now. But this is more than enough drama for one <DAYNIGHT>. Another day, soon. But come, let's catch up with the others.~
@470  = ~No one ever agrees with everything another says or does, even if they are as close as can be. But yes, <CHARNAME>, there is more. There is always more. But I'm not ready to talk about it, yet.~
@471  = ~It seems you are beset on all sides. Assassins, dangerous quests, mysterious enemies, and even your dreams have turned against you. I worry for your safety, <CHARNAME>.~
@472  = ~Gavin, stop trying to mother me.~
@473  = ~Gavin, are you absolutely certain that you aren't overreacting?~
@474  = ~Can we talk about this later?~
@475  = ~Why?~
@476  = ~Your concern is kind, but I think I can take care of myself.~
@477  = ~Why, thank you Gavin! I am naught but a delicate maiden, and need a strong man looking out for my safety.~
@478  = ~Thank you for your concern, Gavin. It's important that we look out for each other.~
@479  = ~Gavin, I begin to think you have singled me out for special attention. I am your companion, and the leader of this party. Nothing more.~
@480  = ~I am not trying to mother you. But I am concerned for your safety. You are our leader, but you are also my friend. I would be most upset if something were to happen to you.~
@481  = ~Gavin, get over yourself. What could *you* do to protect me?~
@482  = ~I know what you meant, Gavin, and that is why I don't want you to worry. You and I are no more than friends to each other.~
@483  = ~I know what you're trying to do, Gavin, and I appreciate it, but if I start thinking about all the danger I am in, I might be paralyzed by fear when I most need to act. Not a healthy situation.~
@484  = ~I am glad you see it that way. It makes me hope that we might yet make it through this. I'd hope anyway, but your caution makes it easier.~
@485  = ~I have my placed my hammer and my spells at your disposal. I had hoped that you would value them.~
@486  = ~Ah... yes, of course. But even a friend may worry. Since it upsets you, though, I shall do it in silence.~
@487  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I am sorry you feel that way. I know it does no good to stumble blindly through life, but I do not think you do that. But I shall drop the subject.~
@488  = ~Quite certain, actually. Nor is your casual dismissal reassuring me. Can you honestly tell me that you are as fearless as you would have me believe?~
@489  = ~How dare you doubt it?~
@490  = ~Gavin, I know what you're trying to do, and I think it's sweet, but I can take care of myself.~
@491  = ~Honestly, Gavin, I don't know what you're worried about.~
@492  = ~I do not doubt it, but I question the advisability of your attitude. When we do not know what we are up against, fear keeps us safe.~
@493  = ~Your cowardice sickens me.~
@494  = ~Gavin, please understand that overcoming fear has been part of my training. I am not lacking in caution, even if I do refuse to give in to fear.~
@495  = ~Gavin, I've been trained to keep my eyes open, and to watch out for all kinds of traps. I am not being reckless.~
@496  = ~I suppose you are right. I will be careful.~
@497  = ~I am sorry I have earned your scorn. But I will not trouble you with my concerns again.~
@498  = ~Yes, of course. I should have realized that. Do continue to be careful, though.~
@499  = ~I should have realized that you would say that. Do continue to be careful, though. There are traps that can kill you even if you know where they are.~
@500  = ~That's what I wanted to hear!~
@501  = ~I know you can. But I want to help.~
@502  = ~I'm worried about everything that seems to be after your blood, that's what! When I think of all the assassins, and kobolds, and bandits, and spiders, and even the gibberlings, and who knows what else, I want to know that you are thinking about preserving your own skin. Be careful, all right?~
@503  = ~I suppose, but we shouldn't put it off too long.~
@504  = ~Is this a better time to talk about my concern for your safety?~
@505  = ~Gavin, are you absolutely certain that you aren't overreating?~
@506  = ~You know, Gavin, I find that I don't want to talk about this after all.~
@507  = ~If you won't have a care for your own safety, there is nothing I can do to force you. I've placed my hammer and my spells at your disposal, but they will do you no good if something out there is faster than I am. And you must admit, there is an awful lot that is.~
@508  = ~*laughs* I'll let you know if I spot one. In the meantime, please tell me that you were joking.~
@509  = ~Of course I was joking, Gavin. You and I both know that I am capable of taking care of myself, but I apreciate your concern, nonetheless.~
@510  = ~Actually, I resent the fact that you seem to regard me as a helpless female. In many ways, I'm stronger than you know.~
@511  = ~I know that in many, many ways, you are stronger than I will ever be. But that does not stop me from being concerned for your safety. I am sorry you resent my concern.~
@512  = ~*You are relaxing with your party in the common room before retiring. Gavin has gone to fetch your drinks.*~
@513  = ~*He seems to be taking quite a while, so you amuse yourself by watching those around you. At a nearby table, a couple appears to be enjoying the early, awkward stages of courtship. At another table, a pair of men appear to be discussing the quality of a pair of boots. Judging from the facial expressions and the energy of their debate, you suspect at least one of the men is dissatisfied. It takes some time to realize that Gavin has not *yet* returned with your order.*~
@514  = ~*You see him emerge from a cluster of people near the bar, red-faced and carrying a tray. To your surprise, an equally red-faced woman is following him, and appears to be trying to continue a conversation. You cannot catch the words, but you can tell that Gavin is not happy about it.*~
@515  = ~*You rise and go over to him, hoping to rescue him from the source of his discomfort.*~
@516  = ~*You rise and go over to him, hoping to find out what they are talking about.*~
@517  = ~*You let him find his way to the table on his own.*~
@518  = ~*Gavin turns slightly to answer some unheard comment and completely fails to see a wet spot on the floor in front of him. For a while, it looks like he might manage to keep his feet, swerving this way and that in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid spilling the contents of the tray. By the time his body concedes defeat and he drops to the floor with the now empty tray on top of him, most of the patrons around him have been liberally doused. His unknown assailant stands in mute shock, mouth open, dripping ale.*~
@519  = ~*You rush over to him and help him to his feet.* Are you all right, Gavin?~
@520  = ~*You rush over to him and jerk him to his feet.* Well, you certainly have caused a scene.~
@521  = ~*You slink back to your table, hoping none of the other patrons will associate your movement with Gavin's approach.*~
@522  = ~I think I've only dented my pride. I apologize, <CHARNAME>, it seems that I have caused a scene.~
@523  = ~You might say that, but that's nothing, if you're all right. You hit the floor pretty hard.~
@524  = ~Maybe, but let's sort out this mess and get out of here as quickly as possible, shall we?~
@525  = ~Well, if you're all right, maybe you can explain who this woman is. Why would she be following you across a taproom?~
@526  = ~With pleasure, but I think we owe these good people an apology, and maybe some compensation. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. My clumsiness is likely to cost us a few gold today.~
@527  = ~It does look that way, but we've handled worse. Who is your friend?~
@528  = ~Oh, Gavin, it is unfortunate, but a little clumsiness is not going to have us scrubbing pots all night. We'll sort it out.~
@529  = ~Well, if you are alright, and these people can be made to forget their inconvenience, maybe you can explain what is going on.~
@530  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, that was Greta. She was a neighbor in Beregost. She was just filling me in on a bit of gossip, but she seems to have left. Maybe we had better buy these people their next round?~
@531  = ~Of course. I'll ask the barkeep to see to it. For old friends, you did not look happy to see each other.~
@532  = ~Of course. I'll ask the barkeep to see to it. It doesn't matter, Gavin. You didn't look too happy about it, so maybe it all worked out for the best.~
@533  = ~Nonsense, Gavin. Flying ale is a known hazard in a place like this. You two did not look happy to see each other.~
@534  = ~Nonsense, Gavin. Flying ale is a known hazard in a place like this. You didn't look too happy about it, so maybe it all worked out for the best.~
@535  = ~I'm fine, but I think we owe these good people an apology, and maybe some compensation. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. My clumsiness is likely to cost us a few gold today.~
@536  = ~*The woman looks icily at you and storms off before Gavin can reply.*~
@537  = ~Oh. Well, <CHARNAME>, that was Greta. She was a neighbor in Beregost. She was just filling me in on a bit of gossip, but she seems to have left. Maybe we had better buy these people their next round?~
@538  = ~That was very generous of you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for paying for my clumsiness. Greta and I never got along very well, and she is happy to remind me of that every time we meet.~
@539  = ~Despite your gesture of goodwill, I am feeling a bit more self-conscious than usual, at the moment. I'm going to bed. I apologize for making such a mess.~
@540  = ~That was very generous of you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for paying for my clumsiness. And thank you for your understanding. Greta and I never got along very well, and she is happy to remind me of that every time we meet.~
@541  = ~I am sorry we caused such a scene. Greta and I never got along very well, and she is happy to remind me of that every time we meet.~
@542  = ~I am feeling a bit more self-conscious than usual, at the moment. I'm going to bed. I apologize for making such a mess.~
@543  = ~Thank you for your understanding. Greta and I never got along very well, and she is happy to remind me of that every time we meet.~
@544  = ~Well, that was a blessing. That, <CHARNAME>, was Greta. She was a neighbor in Beregost. She was just filling me in on a bit of gossip, but she seems to have left. Maybe we had better buy these people their next round?~
@545  = ~I apologize, <CHARNAME>. Damn my clumsiness.~
@546  = ~Oh, Gavin! It is nothing,though, if you're all right. You hit the floor pretty hard.~
@547  = ~*Gavin picks himself up, then collects the tray and spilled mugs in a fine show of self-conscious fumbling. He walks over to your table, his face scarlet and his hands shaking with his humiliation.*~
@548  = ~My word, Gavin, that was quite a performance. It is nothing,though, if you're all right. You hit the floor pretty hard.~
@549  = ~My, that was dreadful. Let's sort out this mess and get out of here as quickly as possible, shall we?~
@550  = ~Who was that woman? Why would she be following you across a taproom?~
@551  = ~That was quite a performance, Gavin. If you've finished your juggling act, maybe we should slip out of here as quietly as possible. If you can manage it. I do not recall ever being more humiliated. Why did you have to come back here, anyway? You should have left the building, after that stunt.~
@552  = ~I sincerely apologize, <CHARNAME>. Damn my clumsiness. Do you really want me to leave?~
@553  = ~No, Gavin. I'm sorry I snapped at you. It was an unfortunate accident. But maybe we should all retire to our rooms.~
@554  = ~Not leave the inn, but leave the common room. You've embarrassed me enough for one evening.~
@555  = ~Yes, Gavin, you should. I'll never be able to show my face around here again. That much is certain. Go stay somewhere else.~
@556  = ~That's all right. It was quite a show. I had not planned on staying in the common room after that, in any case.~
@557  = ~Yes, of course. I had not planned on staying in the common room after that, in any case. I apologize for the discomfort I caused you.~
@558  = ~I apologize for the discomfort I caused you, and I am sorry it has come to this. I will do as you say.~
@559  = ~*When you go back down to the common room after you rise, you do not see Gavin. He usually wakes long before you do, which makes you wonder if he had another mishap and left the building.*~
@560  = ~*The inkeep looks at you darkly when he brings you bread and a bit of cheese, but does not make any reference to the antics of the night before.*~
@561  = ~*Gavin appears at your elbow and eases himself onto a chair beside you.*~
@562  = ~Oh! There you are. I was wondering if you had left.~
@563  = ~Hello, Gavin. I don't know if you need to be quite so unobtrusive. People make mistakes all the time.~
@564  = ~*You say nothing.*~
@565  = ~Oh, look, everyone, here's our acrobat.~
@566  = ~Don't do that, Gavin! I thought you were gone for good!~
@567  = ~Eat as you walk, Gavin. We're leaving.~
@568  = ~I must apologize again for the mess I caused last night. I wish I could say it surprised me, but I know how clumsy I can be. I am frankly surprised that you are even willing to be seen with me this morning.~
@569  = ~Don't be silly. It was an accident, and there was no permanent harm done. Don't let it unhinge you like this.~
@570  = ~Well, let them stare, and snicker up their sleeves! And may they be shown the same lack of compassion the next time they slip and fall.~
@571  = ~We have better things to worry about than the stares of a few townsfolk.~
@572  = ~You really are attractive when you blush like that, Gavin.~
@573  = ~No one died. That's all that's important. But it probably wouldn't hurt to get an early start on today's trip.~
@574  = ~Actually, I was hoping for a repeat performance. I could use a laugh.~
@575  = ~This bears no relation to the events of last night, but I begin to think that a less... personal relationship might be more appropriate.~
@576  = ~Easy for you to say. I really do manage some pretty spectacular displays. Which is kind of surprising, because it seems to come in fits. I can be walking along, no more bungling than the next man, and then, after a feat of amazing clumsiness, I find that I'm somehow lying on the ground amidst the wreckage of something valuable.~
@577  = ~Last night, I feared that thing of value might be our friendship.~
@578  = ~Oh, Gavin. I wouldn't stop being your friend over a few mugs of ale. Honestly, you worry too much.~
@579  = ~*mischevious smile* I'll let it slide this once.~
@580  = ~Not today. ~
@581  = ~Thank you for your kindness. I wish my worry was groundless, but I have a gift for making myself look like a buffoon. I am glad you have the compassion to see beyond it.~
@582  = ~Then I am forever in your debt, O Queen of Mercy!~
@583  = ~I do not know if this is a benefit or a curse, but they will not forget us in a hurry, that much is certain.~
@584  = ~Well, that is a kindness.~
@585  = ~It might be best to linger a bit, or send a runner on ahead to warn people to secure anything breakable.~
@586  = ~O, thou cruel and merciless woman! How you torment me! I live for your smile, but to glimpse it, I must humiliate myself.~
@587  = ~Fear not. I shall likely do your bidding whether you command it or not.~
@588  = ~I don't know if they could manage that spectacular display. It has taken years of training to perfect.~
@589  = ~Not that I understand it completely. It comes in fits. I could be walking along, no more bungling than the next man, and then, after a feat of amazing clumsiness, I find that I'm somehow lying on the ground amidst the wreckage of something valuable.~
@590  = ~But not everyone can cause such widespread damage. I must apologize again for the mess I caused last night. I wish I could say it surprised me, but I know how clumsy I can be. I am frankly surprised that you are even willing to be seen with me this morning.~
@591  = ~*For a while, it looks like Gavin might let it drop, but at last he speaks tentatively.*~
@592  = ~I must apologize again for the mess I caused last night.~
@593  = ~Forget it.~
@594  = ~Just shut up and lets get out of here before you draw a crowd. ~
@595  = ~I wish it would be that easy for either of us.~
@596  = ~*Gavin follows you out in silence.*~
@597  = ~I shall wait for you outside... if you don't mind.~
@598  = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I must apologize again for the mess I caused last night. I wish I could say it surprised me, but I know how clumsy I can be. I am frankly surprised that you are even willing to be seen with me this morning.~
@599  = ~<CHARNAME>, I wanted to apologize for making a fool of myself back at the inn.~
@600  = ~Gavin, can we talk about this later?~
@601  = ~You already did. That really bothered you, didn't it?~
@602  = ~Forget it, Gavin. People make mistakes all the time.~
@603  = ~Is there an echo around here? Why do you keep bringing this up?~
@604  = ~Give it a rest, Gavin. I'd like to forget the whole thing happened, and I can't do that if you keep reminding me.~
@605  = ~Gavin, why does my good opinion seem to matter more to you than that of any of our other companions?~
@606  = ~Yes, of course.~
@607  = ~Do you have a moment. I'd like to talk about what happened at the inn.~
@608  = ~Gavin, I don't want to talk about it.~
@609  = ~You already said you were sorry. That really bothered you, didn't it?~
@610  = ~<CHARNAME>, you should have said so before.~
@611  = ~It did, for a number of reasons. Not the clumsiness. That happens all the time, and I'm used to it by now. What bothers me most is that *you* saw it. I did not want to look the fool in front of you.~
@612  = ~You didn't, Gavin. You slipped.~
@613  = ~Gavin, a woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.~
@614  = ~Gavin, your concern for what I think and how you look in front of me makes me uncomfortable. I do not want you to think about me that much.~
@615  = ~You're trying to tell me something, aren't you?~
@616  = ~People were laughing at me, <CHARNAME>! They were not laughing at me because I had said something clever. They were laughing because I did something foolish. That is not how I wanted you to see me.~
@617  = ~The important thing is that they were laughing. It could have gotten ugly.~
@618  = ~How did you want me to see you?~
@619  = ~I was afraid of this. Gavin, I do not want you to think about me that way.~
@620  = ~Never underestimate the value of humor, Gavin. Some women are drawn more to a man with a few flaws.~
@621  = ~I almost wish it had. A good tavern brawl would have allowed me to burn off some of the self-disgust I felt. I might have managed to impress you with some of the less refined skills I picked up before I became a cleric.~
@622  = ~Why are you trying to impress me?~
@623  = ~You don't have to impress me, Gavin.~
@624  = ~Gavin, you worry too much about what I think.~
@625  = ~Gavin, friends do not have to impress each other.~
@626  = ~I guess it's because you are so impressive, yourself. I am nothing more than an unremarkable cleric of no outstanding ability. And my looks are against me.~
@627  = ~They are not. You look fine.~
@628  = ~Gavin, you don't need to impress me. Just be yourself.~
@629  = ~I think I can see where this is going. I am sorry, Gavin, but I do not return your affection.~
@630  = ~I do own a mirror, you know. But thank you. Your kindness makes me a happy man indeed.~
@631  = ~I have little hope of being anyone else, although I wish I could manage it, sometimes.~
@632  = ~And I wish you had more self-confidence. But we have to do the best we can with what we have.~
@633  = ~I would not want you to be anyone else.~
@634  = ~My opinion does not matter. You are the one that has to live with yourself.~
@635  = ~Gavin, I know what you are trying to tell me. I value your friendship, but I do not have feelings for you.~
@636  = ~Thank you for telling me.~
@637  = ~I am not sure how to interpret that.~
@638  = ~Since you seem to feel that you need my approval, I like you well enough the way you are.~
@639  = ~Gavin, I am sorry, but I cannot return the feelings you seem to have for me.~
@640  = ~Thank... Thank you. There is more... but I think if I keep talking, another bout of clumsiness will claim me. Thank you for being so understanding.~
@641  = ~I wish that I did not feel like I did. I would certainly break less crockery. I guess it's because you are so impressive, yourself. I am nothing more than an unremarkable cleric of no outstanding ability. And my looks are against me.~
@642  = ~*blushes scarlet and staggers, but catches himself* That might be true if you were not so impressive, yourself. I am nothing more than an unremarkable cleric of no outstanding ability. And my looks are against me.~
@643  = ~Certainly not as a buffoon. I would have liked to be more... impressive.~
@644  = ~Then I am certain not to disappoint. Still, I sometimes wish I were more... impressive in a way that was not so comical.~
@645  = ~That might be true, <CHARNAME>, but if you were laughing, it was not because I had said something clever. It was because I had done something foolish. That is not how I wanted you to see me.~
@646  = ~How do you know I wouldn't have done the same thing myself?~
@647  = ~Unlikely, for an impressive woman like you. Although I wish it were otherwise, I am nothing more than an unremarkable cleric of no outstanding ability. And my looks are against me.~
@648  = ~I suppose I am. I'm apologizing to you again, but I guess I'm really asking you not to judge me based on that fiasco.~
@649  = ~I only wish I could. Not the clumsiness. That happens all the time, and I'm used to it by now. What bothers me most is that *you* saw it. I did not want to look the fool in front of you.~
@650  = ~I keep talking about it because every time my mind wanders, that scene plays out in head, again and again. It upset me greatly. Not the clumsiness. That happens all the time, and I'm used to it by now. What bothers me most is that *you* saw it. I did not want to look the fool in front of you.~
@651  = ~I only wish I could. Every time my mind wanders, that scene plays out in my head, again and again. It upset me greatly. Can we talk about it?~
@652  = ~Gavin, you made a fool of yourself. You do that a lot. I do not think I have enough patience to hear any more of your explanations.~
@653  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. It is easy to overlook the fact that you were probably even more uncomfortable than I was. Go ahead and talk about it, if it makes you feel better.~
@654  = ~I see. I am sorry I have become such a burden. You will not have to listen to any more explanations from me.~
@655  = ~Thank you for being so understanding. My clumsiness doesn't bother me too much, anymore. It's nothing new, and I'm used to it by now. What bothers me most is that *you* saw it. I did not want to look the fool in front of you.~
@656  = ~Your opinion matters more to me because *you* matter more to me. My clumsiness doesn't bother me too much, anymore. It's nothing new, and I'm used to it by now. What bothers me most is that *you* saw it. I did not want to look the fool in front of you.~
@657  = ~<CHARNAME>, may I... that is, would you mind if I...~
@658  = ~*Gavin's kiss is sudden, tender, and brief.*~
@659  = ~Thank you.~
@660  = ~Hmmm. That man over there has been looking at you for some time.~
@661  = ~Do you think it's important?~
@662  = ~Are you jealous?~
@663  = ~It's probably because I'm an elf. Some people distrust us.~
@664  = ~It's probably because I'm a half-elf. Some people seem to think we're an abomination to both races.~
@665  = ~You'd think he'd never seen a human before.~
@666  = ~Dwarves aren't all that common around here, I guess.~
@667  = ~How many halflings do you see around here?~
@668  = ~You don't see many gnomes, it's true. Certainly, not around here.~
@669  = ~I'm used to it, Gavin. People tend to stare at half-orcs.~
@670  = ~Can you blame him?~
@671  = ~I'm in the middle of something, Gavin. Can it wait?~
@672  = ~If you mean "Do I think he's a danger to us?" then no. But I'd be lying if I said I liked the way he was looking at you.~
@673  = ~What do you mean?~
@674  = ~Ooh, where is he? Is he attractive?~
@675  = ~He seems to admire your appearance.~
@676  = ~I see. This seems to bother you. Do you want to talk about it?~
@677  = ~So?~
@678  = ~Then he has good taste.~
@679  = ~Over there, but never mind that for now. He seems to admire your appearance.~
@680  = ~Maybe a bit, but never mind that for now. He seems to admire your appearance.~
@681  = ~I do not think that is it at all. He seems to admire your appearance.~
@682  = ~And others perceive half-elves as the perfection of both races, capturing the beauty of each. I suspect that may be the case. He seems to admire your appearance.~
@683  = ~If they are not common, perhaps he wishes they were. He seems to admire your appearance.~
@684  = ~Not many, true, but I do not think that is why he is staring at you. He seems to admire your appearance.~
@685  = ~Maybe, but I do not think he sees you as a monster. He seems to admire your appearance.~
@686  = ~Not at all, but it is clear that he admires your appearance.~
@687  = ~I suppose it would be best. If you don't mind, though, would you mind moving away from the others? I would rather this stay between us.~
@688  = ~Gavin, if you're going to try to justify your jealousy, I don't think we need to speak in private.~
@689  = ~Is it absolutely necessary?~
@690  = ~Of course, Gavin.~
@691  = ~Would you mind moving away from the others? I would rather this stay between us.~
@692  = ~I would hardly argue that. But I must speak with you. Would you mind moving away from the others? I would rather this stay between us.~
@693  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is important, and no simple matter of jealousy. You are beautiful. I will not attempt to refute that claim. I would expect people to stare at you for that reason alone. But...~
@694  = ~Are you determined to list your insecurities yet again?~
@695  = ~There is more, isn't there?~
@696  = ~We don't have to talk about this if you don't want to, Gavin.~
@697  = ~Is that how you see me? As a collection of insecurities?~
@698  = ~No, Gavin. That came out wrong. I don't see you that way at all, but sometimes, I think that you do. You talk about them as if they define you, but I know that they do not.~
@699  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, that just slipped out. I didn't mean it.~
@700  = ~You aren't the most confident of men.~
@701  = ~Don't become angry with me! You go on about your faults constantly, as if acknowledgement excused them.~
@702  = ~Then you are most understanding. And probably right. But that was not what was upsetting me. There is more.~
@703  = ~It would not have "slipped out" if you were not already thinking it. Never mind. That was not what was upsetting me. There is more.~
@704  = ~No, I am not. But that was not what was upsetting me. There is more.~
@705  = ~I am sorry my lack of confidence has placed such a burden on our friendship. It will not happen again.~
@706  = ~Yes, I am afraid we do need to talk.~
@707  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is something I have not told you about my past. I have not lied to you, but I have concealed things that you need to know. That stranger's attention has provoked my jealousy, and you need to know why. I am not talking about the emotion itself. You need to know everything I have been hiding, or every sweet word I say to you from now on will be meaningless.~
@708  = ~Go on.~
@709  = ~Gavin, I'm not that interested. I do not want to know about your past. I do not want to know any more about you. If that means you will stop courting me, so be it.~
@710  = ~I am sorry that you feel that way.~
@711  = ~I went to the Song of the Morning Temple when I was twelve. You know that. I was consumed by my faith, and the love of Lathander. There was little room in my life for much else. I had little contact with the world outside the temple. I knew little of the world, and even less about women. There were female novices, and I befriended several, but they were friends and classmates.~
@712  = ~When I was ordained, I was expected to go out into the world, spreading the word of Lathander and doing his work. I pursued the task eagerly. My first assignment was right within Beregost. I had not been there long when I met a young woman about my age. One thing led to another, and I fell in love.~
@713  = ~I've heard enough.~
@714  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is possibly the most important part of my past. Are you sure you don't want to hear it?~
@715  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. Go on.~
@716  = ~Please do not fault me for my foolish heart. I was young, I had fulfilled my dream of becoming a Dawnbringer, and I was confident in my ability to change the world. Why should I not fall in love with the first woman who was willing to entertain pleasant conversation with me?~
@717  = ~I was entirely innocent. The possibility of emotional love made me giddy with delight. The possibility of physical love both terrified and intrigued me. I did not decline her favor when she offered it.~
@718  = ~Not long afterward, she told me that she was with child. I was heartbroken. Not about her pregnancy. I was looking forward to becoming a father. I was devastated because I knew that she had been unfaithful. We had been courting for almost a year before she let me into her bed. She gave me the news scarce days later. She could not have known that quickly.~
@719  = ~The day I found out, I had intended to propose marriage to her. I was now faced with a horrible decision. My heart cried out against marrying a woman who had been unfaithful to me, but I still loved her, and I did not want her babe to grow up fatherless.~
@720  = ~I did something I now regret. I stayed with her, never telling her that I knew her secret. When Lanie was born, some seven months later, I acknowledged her as mine, and prayed that Miranda's infidelity was behind her. Even so, I could not bring myself to marry her.~
@721  = ~Years went by. I loved Lanie as my daughter. She grew more beautiful and more clever with every passing day. I was as proud of her as any natural father could be.~
@722  = ~So why are you not with them still?~
@723  = ~I don't know what to say. Is there more to tell?~
@724  = ~You broke faith with them.~
@725  = ~The knowledge you have given me has surpassed my curiosity greatly. Gavin, I really do not want to know any more about this. If this means we're through, so be it.~
@726  = ~We are nearly at the end of my tale. I would be with them, still, had Miranda's... desire for men other than me been satisfied. After Lanie's birth, I had been prepared to forget any past unpleasantness. I would have gladly forgotten my hurt and married her and would have happily enlarged our family further. But she never again welcomed my touch.~
@727  = ~I took it as the distance some new mothers place between themselves and men, and did not realize the full scope of the matter. Her distaste for male company extended only as far as my own person, I later found out. Her affection was free enough with others while I was away on temple business. She would leave Lanie with a neighbor and disappear for days at a time.~
@728  = ~I knew of it, but there was little I could do. I could have abandoned my duty to the temple if my absence was causing her to look elsewhere, and I had no legal claim on Miranda's affection. I had sworn no vow, but neither had she. That was the day I swore that I would not... indulge in intimacy with any woman I had not sworn to wed.~
@729  = ~Finally, Miranda pushed me too far. She brought a stranger into the bed we shared out of habit. I returned from a journey and our neighbor Roe asked after a new boarder he had seen many times in the garden with Lanie and Miranda.~
@730  = ~I did the only thing I could. I left.~
@731  = ~You left them to fend for themselves?~
@732  = ~What about your daughter? Even if she is not your natural daughter, you claimed her as yours. You owed her more than an expedient farewell.~
@733  = ~I feel as if you've lied to me. You presented yourself as a free man, but I see you have left commitments behind.~
@734  = ~Gavin, I don't know what to say. Why are you telling me all this?~
@735  = ~But you're done with them, right?~
@736  = ~I did not. Please, allow me to continue.~
@737  = ~I most certainly owe her more than that! I have a debt to Lanie that goes beyond blood. By claiming her as my daughter, I have committed myself to caring for her for the rest of my life. I will never break that promise. I tried to tell her how much I love her, and I visit her whenever I can. She still calls me "Daddy."~
@738  = ~I also see to her wellbeing. I send her every penny I earn beyond what I need to stay alive. That is why I looked so impoverished that day we met outside the temple. And that is part of the reason I decided to take up adventuring. Lanie is showing signs of remarkable talent. With the right education, I believe she can become a great scholar and perhaps learn to harness magic. I make sure that Lanie does not want for anything.~
@739  = ~If you have done right by your daughter, you have done all you could. Don't you miss her, though?~
@740  = ~If you have done right by your daughter, you have done all you could. Will this prevent you from leading your own life?~
@741  = ~Gavin, this is too much. I do not need all this drama. I realize that you might consider me close to you, but I would never choose a man who has already failed one family.~
@742  = ~I see why you felt you had to tell me. But now you must listen to me. I will not share a man with a child.~
@743  = ~Thank you for telling me. You were right in doing so, even if it was difficult for you. We'll work it out, Gavin.~
@744  = ~You are even more wonderful than I dared hope. Thank you for being so understanding.~
@745  = ~If you would compete with a child for the love of her father, I was wrong to have thought so highly of you.~
@746  = ~Only my promise to see you through to the end of your quest prevents me from leaving this instant.~
@747  = ~Don't let that stop you!~
@748  = ~As much as I hate to say it, I do need a cleric.~
@749  = ~Gavin, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! Please don't go!~
@750  = ~I will stay for that reason, and that reason alone.~
@751  = ~I am sorry, but there is no way to unsay what you said. You might regret saying what was in your heart, but you spoke right the first time. You will never need to share at least one man with a child, because my first responsibility is my daughter's wellbeing. She is the innocent victim of adult folly, and should not have to pay for the crimes of others. If you cannot accept that, we have no future.~
@752  = ~Maybe someday, you will come to learn that love is an infinite thing, and giving to one does not mean another must do without. I, however, will not make my daughter wait for "someday."~
@753  = ~I am sorry you feel that way, but I have no choice but to accept your decision.~
@754  = ~No. I am free to travel as I choose, as long as my daughter is provided for. I am also free to love, or to have a family. The love of a child does not diminish the love of a woman, but the woman needs a great deal of patience and strength of character to understand that. Even so, I dare to hope... I must say no more right now. But I am glad you understand my obligations.~
@755  = ~More than words can describe. I hope that one day, I might be able to have her with me again, maybe as part of a complete family. But I dream too much and too quickly. At the present, I must content myself with the fact that you seem perfectly able to understand what I was trying to tell you.~
@756  = ~I know that. I have a debt to Lanie that goes beyond blood. By claiming her as my daughter, I have committed myself to caring for her for the rest of my life. I will never break that promise. I tried to tell her how much I love her, and I visit her whenever I can. She still calls me "Daddy."~
@757  = ~I am sorry you feel that way. I am even more sorry that my own cowardice has compounded the problem. When I joined you, I thought myself safe from any complications, but I see now how mistaken I was. I saw this as a chance to try again in a group that knew nothing of my past. I did not set out to deceive you, but I would be lying if I said that I did not choose what to tell you. And now, I am paying the price for my half-truth.~
@758  = ~You need to understand that my debt to Lanie goes beyond mere blood. By claiming her as my daughter, I have committed myself to caring for her for the rest of my life. I will never break that promise. I tried to tell her how much I love her, and I visit her whenever I can. She still calls me "Daddy."~
@759  = ~Gavin, had you told me at first what you are telling me now, I might have understood. But I cannot get past the lie.~
@760  = ~I am telling you because I owe you an explanation for telling you half-truths. I also need you to understand that my debt to Lanie goes beyond blood. By claiming her as my daughter, I have committed myself to caring for her for the rest of my life. I will never break that promise. I tried to tell her how much I love her, and I visit her whenever I can. She still calls me "Daddy."~
@761  = ~I will never be "done with them" in the sense you mean. I have a debt to Lanie that goes beyond blood. By claiming her as my daughter, I have committed myself to caring for her for the rest of my life. I will never break that promise. I tried to tell her how much I love her, and I visit her whenever I can. She still calls me "Daddy."~
@762  = ~It can wait a little while, but not forever.~
@763  = ~I hope this is a better time to talk about that man's attention.~
@764  = ~Is this really important, Gavin? I don't have time to waste on foolish jealousy.~
@765  = ~This is no matter of jealousy. Threre is something I must tell you, and it can wait no longer. If I do not speak of it, every sweet word I would say to you from now on would be meaningless. Will you listen?~
@766  = ~<CHARNAME>, I've been thinking about how fortunate I am.~
@767  = ~Oh?~
@768  = ~Can this wait a little while, Gavin?~
@769  = ~Is this a better time for a chat?~
@770  = ~Yes.~
@771  = ~I don't really want to talk at all right now.~
@772  = ~Very well. Maybe I was mistaken.~
@773  = ~I am surely among the most fortunate of men. I have something few others can claim.~
@774  = ~Gavin, sometimes talking to you is like trying to wiggle a snail out of its shell.~
@775  = ~Have you always wanted to be an adventurer?~
@776  = ~Please tell me that you do not ascribe your happiness to my presence.~
@777  = ~And I am among the most beset of women. Honestly, Gavin, what are you talking about?~
@778  = ~Oh no, dear one, my good humor is not likely to be dampened so easily. I have been given a gift: the chance to try again.~
@779  = ~I thought the followers of Lathander believed there is always another morning.~
@780  = ~Don't you mean to say that you have the chance to start over?~
@781  = ~Does this mean you are about to embark on another philosophical journey?~
@782  = ~I liked it better when you were moody.~
@783  = ~Oh no, dear one, not since I was very small. I am happy because I have been given a gift: the chance to try again.~
@784  = ~Not entirely, dear one. I am happy because I have been given a gift: the chance to try again.~
@785  = ~We say that we do, and on some level we believe it. We are probably less prone to despair than some, certainly. But when the night is dark, and the wind is chill, and you hear the wolves moving outside the circle of dying firelight, you believe the morning will come, but you might not be there to see it.~
@786  = ~It is said that it is always darkest before the dawn, but that is a lie. Dawn does not spring suddenly into being. As a cleric of Lathander, I've seen enough of them to know. It creeps gradually across the landscape. The sky brightens, the cold grey nighttime world grows lighter, and an expectant hush fills the world. The first birdsong heralds the rays of the young sun as it mounts the horizon. The sky fills with color. Then sun rises, the world itself loses its greyness, and all is filled with warmth and light. The majesty of Lathander banishes even the memory of darkness.~
@787  = ~The wolves can kill you just as well by daylight.~
@788  = ~How does this relate to your good mood?~
@789  = ~And this makes you happy, even though you know that night will fall again?~
@790  = ~Are you going to keep talking in circles, or are you going to come to a point?~
@791  = ~In a sense, but one based on what has gone before. One sunrise does not undo what happened the day before. But there is always another sunrise.~
@792  = ~You will hear the followers of Lathander say that a lot. We say that, and on some level we believe it. We are probably less prone to despair than some, certainly. But when the night is dark, and the wind is chill, and you hear the wolves moving outside the circle of dying firelight, you believe the morning will come, but you might not be there to see it.~
@793  = ~You can never really "start over," but you can try again. One sunrise does not undo what happened the day before. But there is always another sunrise.~
@794  = ~And I will be moody again, but not right now. Even as there is always another sunset, there is always another sunrise.~
@795  = ~Hush. You're ruining my story.~
@796  = ~Patience, patience. I'm nearly there.~
@797  = ~And the sun will rise again. But I am only concerned with one sunrise at a time. But I'm almost at the important part.~
@798  = ~So, the sun rises, the day dawns, and life returns to Toril. But each new day flows from the one before, so the wise would do well to learn from it. And that is why it is possible to try again, but never to start over.~
@799  = ~I am happy because I am doing good in the world, because I have good company beside me, and because I can finally be at peace with the past. My sun is rising.~
@800  = ~I am glad that you are happy.~
@801  = ~There are still choices to be made, you know. Nothing is certain...~
@802  = ~Get a hold of yourself, Gavin. The sun may be rising on your world, but it's pretty damn dark where I'm standing.~
@803  = ~*Grinning, he seizes your hand and pulls you into a light embrace. Suddenly tender, he kisses your upturned face, first one cheek, then the other, then your lips. His eyes close, and he kisses you again.*~
@804  = ~*Gavin is smiling when you part.* Let's face the day.~
@805  = ~What is a sunrise without a few clouds?~
@806  = ~Sometimes, the sun rises, but clouds hide it. Do not lose faith in the sunrise because you cannot see it.~
@807  = ~*Gavin gently takes your hand and draws you into a tentative embrace. Suddenly tender, he kisses your upturned face, first one cheek, then the other, then your lips. His eyes close, and he kisses you again.*~
@808  = ~I've been thinking about death, lately.~
@809  = ~Gavin, you're frightening me. One day, you're all smiles and warmth, the next, you're brooding about death.~
@810  = ~Why so morbid?~
@811  = ~Have you had any revelations?~
@812  = ~Oh, I'm not depressed about death! Few Lathandrites are. It's all part of the Great Cycle, and when it's time to die, it's time to die. My thoughts had more to do with the lifespan disparity between humans and other races. You are an elf. Your life will span centuries. I am human. I'll be dead and gone in another sixty or seventy years, and you will not yet have reached the prime of life.~
@813  = ~Does this bother you?~
@814  = ~Are you trying to tell me something?~
@815  = ~I think I see where you are going with this.~
@816  = ~Are you saying that it is wrong for humans and elves to form attachments?~
@817  = ~All the better for elves! Why, if an elf were to take nothing but human lovers, she could have as many suitors as she wanted!~
@818  = ~There are ways to extend life, Gavin.~
@819  = ~Not precisely. That is the blessing of my kind. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to an elf, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the elf.~
@820  = ~Gavin, what are you trying to say?~
@821  = ~In your purely hypothetical story, then, would it be wrong for the human to love the elf, or the elf to love the human?~
@822  = ~Is it better to face loss or to forfeit love that is offered?~
@823  = ~Which is why I will never love a human.~
@824  = ~Oh, hells! I was trying to confine this to the hypothetical, but I see that is impossible.~
@825  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are no doubt aware of my affection for you. You have not sent me away, so I cling to the hope that you find me at least marginally... acceptable. I am asking you to think about what it really means for an elf to love a human.~
@826  = ~If I should give in to my feelings for you, I have the comfort of knowing that if I lose you, it will be through accident, illness, or by choice. If you should return those feelings, you would have to face losing me to a natural death while you are still a young, vibrant, and beautiful woman.~
@827  = ~Gavin, I already knew this. Pairings between elves and humans are not unheard of.~
@828  = ~I had not thought of that.~
@829  = ~It is not yet time to decide.~
@830  = ~Why would you think that I find you acceptable simply because I have not yet sent you away?~
@831  = ~That is true. But that leads to another hard question that I wish I could phrase in the abstract. How do you feel about knowing that I will die before you will?~
@832  = ~I am not yet ready to commit to any man. I will make that decision when the time comes.~
@833  = ~It is better to face the death of a lover than to live with the regret of refusing the love offered?~
@834  = ~If you and I are fated to be together, than who am I to deny the will of the gods?~
@835  = ~I never told you that I wanted a love that would last even a human lifetime.~
@836  = ~That is fair enough. I did not start this conversation to secure a commitment from you, only to give you something to think about.~
@837  = ~You are a remarkable woman, <CHARNAME>. Your understanding is matched only by your compassion. I will not ask you to make that choice quite yet, but I am far happier knowing how you feel about mortality.~
@838  = ~That might be taking it a little far, but I'm not complaining! I don't know if my feelings for you are the will of the gods or my own wishful thinking, at this point, but your own ready acceptance of this possibility makes me hopeful.~
@839  = ~No, you did not. Nor am I asking you to do so now. I am only asking you to consider your wellbeing and contentment before making any decisions.~
@840  = ~Perhaps you should. If things develop much further between us, you will eventually have to face the near-certainty that I will die before you will.~
@841  = ~No, it is not. But if things develop much further between us, you will eventually have to face the near-certainty that I will die before you will.~
@842  = ~Oh, my. It seems that I have made a fool of myself once again. Please forgive me for mistaking your encouragement for affection.~
@843  = ~In a way. My kind is blessed with a short lifespan. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to an elf, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the elf.~
@844  = ~Do you?~
@845  = ~You are trying to tell me that it is wrong for humans and elves to love each other.~
@846  = ~You are asking me to consider what will happen to the elf when her human lover dies.~
@847  = ~You are about to embark on a tragic tale about how our love is doomed.~
@848  = ~Gods, no! I'm saying that my kind is blessed with a short lifespan. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to an elf, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the elf.~
@849  = ~Exactly. My kind is blessed with a short lifespan. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to an elf, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the elf.~
@850  = ~Not quite. My kind is blessed with a short lifespan. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to an elf, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the elf.~
@851  = ~Gods, no! I'm just saying that they need to be aware of the implications of that decision. My kind is blessed with a short lifespan. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to an elf, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the elf.~
@852  = ~Is that what you want? A string of human lovers, to bury and mourn throughout your long life?~
@853  = ~My kind is blessed with a short lifespan. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to an elf, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the elf.~
@854  = ~None I would consider. I am a cleric of Lathander. I do not fear death, but I do not mock it, either. Life extending magic does naught but interrupt the Great Cycle, and there is a price, for one of my faith.~
@855  = ~Oh, I'm not depressed about death! Few Lathandrites are. It's all part of the Great Cycle, and when it's time to die, it's time to die. My thoughts had more to do with the lifespan disparity between humans and other races. You are a <PRO_RACE>, so your expected lifespan is about the same as mine, within a decade or so, but such is not always the case.~
@856  = ~Is this important to you?~
@857  = ~It is both a blessing and a curse. You know I am in favor of forging bonds of cooperation and even love across racial boundaries, but that becomes more difficult when one race has a much shorter life expectancy than another. Between a human and a <PRO_RACE>, all is well. Both parties conduct their lives at the same pace, and both think of time in the same way. But why would an elf, who could expect to live for centuries, bother to befriend or love a human, who will be dead in a handful of decades?~
@858  = ~Because it is worthwhile.~
@859  = ~So what of the human and the <PRO_RACE>? Similar life expectancy is hardly the most important part of any friendship between them.~
@860  = ~Are you going somewhere with this?~
@861  = ~So, how does your hypothetical friendship between the human and the <PRO_RACE> end?~
@862  = ~Yes, it is, but not everyone agrees. But I was speaking about something less hypothetical. I am thankful that our lives will unfold at the same pace. It gives us a better... understanding of each other.~
@863  = ~No, it is not, but thier lives - our lives - will unfold at the same pace. It gives us a better... understanding of each other.~
@864  = ~Not really. I'm just thankful that our lives will unfold at the same pace. It gives us a better... understanding of each other.~
@865  = ~Maybe it doesn't.~

@870  = ~Are you saying that it is wrong for a human and a <PRO_RACE> to form an attachment?~
@871  = ~Not precisely. That is the blessing of my kind. Again, barring misfortune, if... a human... should give his heart to a <PRO_RACE>, he would never have to suffer the loss of his lover. My concern would be for... the <PRO_RACE>.~
@872  = ~In your purely hypothetical story, then, would it be wrong for the human to love the <PRO_RACE>, or the <PRO_RACE> to love the human?~
@873  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are no doubt aware of my affection for you. You have not sent me away, so I cling to the hope that you find me at least marginally... acceptable. I am asking you to think about what it really means for a <PRO_RACE> to love a human.~
@874  = ~If I should give in to my feelings for you, I have the comfort of knowing that if I lose you, it will be through accident, illness, or by choice. If you should return those feelings, you would have to face losing me to a natural death while you are still a vibrant, beautiful woman.~
@875  = ~Gavin, I already knew this.~

@888  = ~Gavin, are you all right?~
@889  = ~Is there a reason you are stripping out here in the open?~
@890  = ~Are we under attack?~
@891  = ~What is it?!~
@892  = ~eeeEEW! *pant, pant* Yes, I think so... Damned spider crawled into my armor!~
@893  = ~Don't kill it!~
@894  = ~Oh, Gavin! Stop being such a baby.~
@895  = ~Did it bite you?~
@896  = ~Is it out, now?~
@897  = ~I bloody well will kill it if I find the little bugger! Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but... Look, I don't want to talk about it. You know how I feel about spiders.~
@898  = ~Spiders deserve to live, too, Gavin. You can't go around killing harmless little creatures because they frighten you.~
@899  = ~Gavin, grow up. You are a grown man, and have no reason to be afraid of something no bigger than your thumbnail.~
@900  = ~I suppose it's a waste of time to try to reason with you.~
@901  = ~If you've pulled yourself together, we should go on.~
@902  = ~Are you all right?~
@903  = ~They might deserve to live, but they shouldn't do so on me! It makes my skin crawl just thinking about them touching me, creeping over my skin... Good gods... I feel faint.~
@904  = ~You're breathing too fast, Gavin. Just slow down, take a breath, count to ten, then let it out really slowly.~
@905  = ~You really are a trial, Gavin! It was barely an inch long!~
@906  = ~You know, Gavin, when we camp, they probably crawl over you all night long.~
@907  = ~*Say nothing and help him gather the gear he scattered in his panic.*~
@908  = ~*does as you say* Thanks. Sorry about that. Panicked.~
@909  = ~You don't react this badly when we fight them. Why was this so different?~
@910  = ~Are you all right now?~
@911  = ~We're going to have to see if we can get cured of this somehow. You're a cleric. Is there nothing that can be done?~
@912  = ~I guess it was because my life wasn't in danger, just my dignity.~
@913  = ~You're among friends, and you're just fine as you are. Come on, now, let's get your gear back together again.~
@914  = ~You do your best when it counts, and that's all that matters. Come on now, let's get your gear back together again.~
@915  = ~Dignity is overrated. Come on, let's go.~
@916  = ~Just pull yourself together and let's go.~
@917  = ~Did you know you squeal like a woman?~
@918  = ~*kisses your forehead* You're wonderful.~
@919  = ~Thanks.~
@920  = ~If you say so.~
@921  = ~Right.~
@922  = ~Er...no. So much for manliness.~
@923  = ~I think so. Thanks. Let me just get gear back together again.~
@924  = ~Nothing that I've ever been able to find. Fear is a curse, but not the magical kind. The priests at the Song of the Morning said there was nothing that could be done for me, and they're among the best healers I've met. I try to live with it as best I can, but there are moments like this that rob me of any shred of dignity.~
@925  = ~That isn't the point. It wasn't just brushing me or striking me, it was completely on my body!~
@926  = ~*ahem* Anyway, sorry about that. I wish I could say it would't happen again.~
@927  = ~Oh gods, I didn't need to think about that! I'm an uneasy sleeper at the best of times, and you go and tell me that!~
@928  = ~*Gavin scoops up his gear and tries to pretend nothing happened.*~
@929  = ~That isn't the point. It wasn't just brushing against me or striking me, it was completely on my body!~
@930  = ~Hasn't worked so far. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about them touching me, creeping over my skin... Good gods... I feel faint.~
@931  = ~Right. Sorry about that.~
@932  = ~Nothing hurt but my dignity.~
@933  = ~Easy for you to say! Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but... Look, I don't want to talk about it. You know how I feel about spiders.~
@934  = ~Well, no, but that isn't the point! Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but... Look, I don't want to talk about it. You know how I feel about spiders.~
@935  = ~I think so. Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but... Look, I don't want to talk about it. You know how I feel about spiders.~

@937  = ~eeeEEW! *pant, pant* No, just me... Damned spider crawled into my armor!~
@938  = ~Fear is a strange emotion, <CHARNAME>.~
@939  = ~It is, Gavin, and you would know.~
@940  = ~In what way?~
@941  = ~If you are trying to make me forget about your... lapse, you can forget it.~
@942  = ~It is.~
@943  = ~<CHARNAME>, I've been thinking about fear and how it relates to the future. Our future. Can we talk about it?~
@944  = ~Yes, Gavin. What is on your mind?~
@945  = ~I'm not sure we have a future.~
@946  = ~Gavin, I'm not ready to talk about... the future.~
@947  = ~Thank you for hearing this out. I'm not talking about my fear of spiders. I'm talking about the uncertainty that we will even live to see tomorrow. I have faith in your abilities as an individual and as a leader, but you have to be lucky every time. Our foes only have to be lucky once.~
@948  = ~You're starting to sound like Xan.~
@949  = ~Are you telling me it's hopeless?~
@950  = ~Does fate have a part in your prophesy?~
@951  = ~Are you trying to end our relationship?~
@952  = ~You might be right. We face uncertainty every day. We might not even live to see tomorrow. I have faith in your abilities as an individual and as a leader, but you have to be lucky every time. Our foes only have to be lucky once.~
@953  = ~That's it, then. It's over.~
@954  = ~Xan is no fool. I am not saying that we should not plan for tomorrow because we'll never live to see it! I just want to do everything we can to make sure we're both around to enjoy it. I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to sharing stories of our adventures with my grandchildren someday.~
@955  = ~Which uncertainty are you talking about, Gavin? The uncertainty of tomorrow, or the uncertainty of grandchildren?~
@956  = ~I don't want to think that far into the future.~
@957  = ~I don't know about the grandchildren part, but I'm definitely planning to live to a ripe old age.~
@958  = ~I know what you mean! I'm looking forward to putting this behind me.~
@959  = ~I'm all for planning for the future, but grandchildren are never going to be part of it.~
@960  = ~I'm not meant for settling down, Gavin. I intend to die with a blade in my hand and the thrill of adventure still in my blood.~
@961  = ~A little of both, really. I am always concerned about your wellbeing, so naturally I would feel better knowing you are doing your best to stay safe. But I also wanted to know how you felt about having a family.~
@962  = ~I would like children someday, but not right now.~
@963  = ~To tell you the truth, I can't wait to start a family of my own. The sooner, the better.~
@964  = ~I don't really want children, Gavin.~
@965  = ~You recently asked me to think about mortality. If I were to have a family with a human, he would not live to see any children born of that match come of age.~
@966  = ~There is no way I am falling for that trap! No fetters for me!~
@967  = ~I didn't mean right now! At least not until your quest is over... I mean... Well, I'm glad you're in favor of a family, someday. I've got Lanie, but I always wanted at least one more child myself.~
@968  = ~Would you have Lanie live with you?~
@969  = ~We'll see what the fates deal, I guess.~
@970  = ~Gavin, I value your... friendship, but it is possible that the fates have plans for me that do not include you.~
@971  = ~I'd like that very much.~
@972  = ~Of course. You have to understand that even though my blood does not flow in Lanie's veins, my heart does not know the difference. She is just as much my daughter as if I had sired her, and I want her to live with me as often as her education will allow.~
@973  = ~It is probably nothing more than wishful thinking. I can't imagine that Miranda will want to be parted from her any more than I do. I have faith that we will be able to reach an agreement, but I'm always going to want to have Lanie with me. Does this displease you?~
@974  = ~Not at all! I'd like that very much.~
@975  = ~That is always the way of it. But sometimes, the fates are kind.~
@976  = ~It is, but I am a patient man. I will wait until the fates see fit to reveal their plans.~
@977  = ~That makes me very happy.~
@978  = ~Did you mean right now?! Well, you'd have to wait until your quest is over, certainly... I mean... I'm glad you're in favor of a family. I've got Lanie, but I always wanted at least one more child myself.~
@979  = ~I didn't mean right now! At least not until your quest is over... I mean... Well, I've got Lanie, but I always wanted at least one more child.~
@980  = ~Not even Lanie, Gavin. I just don't want children at all.~
@981  = ~I'm very sorry you feel that way. For one thing, it makes it impossible for things to go further between us. You have to understand that even though my blood does not flow in Lanie's veins, my heart does not know the difference. I am sorry it had to be this way.~
@982  = ~That might be just as true were we both human. As I said, death is always a possibility. But you are not adverse to having a family, then. I've got Lanie, but I always wanted at least one more child myself.~
@983  = ~That is unfortunate. I've got Lanie, but I always wanted at least one more child.~
@984  = ~Sooner or later, everyone has to think of the future. I am always concerned about your wellbeing, so naturally I would feel better knowing you are doing your best to stay safe. But I also wanted to know how you felt about having a family.~
@985  = ~I am relieved to hear you say that you plan to take care of yourself. I am always concerned about your wellbeing, so naturally I would feel better knowing you are doing your best to stay safe. But I also wanted to know how you felt about having a family.~
@986  = ~You recently asked me to think about mortality. If I were to have a family with a human, that human would not live to see any children born of that match come of age.~
@987  = ~Nothing is ever hopeless! I am not saying that we should not plan for tomorrow because we'll never live to see it! I just want to do everything we can to make sure we're both around to enjoy it. I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to sharing stories of our adventures with my grandchildren someday.~
@988  = ~Fate plays a part in everyone's future, but we still have the power to make our own choices. I am not saying that we should not plan for tomorrow because we'll never live to see it! I just want to do everything we can to make sure we're both around to enjoy it. I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to sharing stories of our adventures with my grandchildren someday.~
@989  = ~Good gods, no! I am not saying that we should not plan for tomorrow because we'll never live to see it! I just want to do everything we can to make sure we're both around to enjoy it. I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to sharing stories of our adventures with my grandchildren someday.~
@990  = ~I am very sory you feel that way.~
@991  = ~Gods, no! I'm talking about the uncertainty that we will even live to see tomorrow. I have faith in your abilities as an individual and as a leader, but you have to be lucky every time. Our foes only have to be lucky once.~
@992  = ~If you're referring to the spider incident, that isn't what I meant. I've been thinking about fear and how it relates to the future. Our future. Can we talk about it?~
@993  = ~Fear can hold you powerless, but it can also let you see things with great clarity. I've been thinking about fear and how it relates to the future. Our future. Can we talk about it?~
@994  = ~Have you ever been in love?~
@995  = ~What kind of question is that?~
@996  = ~I thought I was... but I was mistaken.~
@997  = ~Yes, but the object of my affection did not return my desire.~
@998  = ~Perhaps...~
@999  = ~I am in love, Gavin.~
@1000 = ~Never.~
@1001 = ~A very difficult one. Do you know how it feels to be in love?~
@1002 = ~I thought so... but I was mistaken.~
@1003 = ~Do you... think you could ever... feel love for a poor, clumsy fool of a man?~
@1004 = ~Do you mean to ask me if I could ever feel love for you?~
@1005 = ~Is there a reason you're asking me this now?~
@1006 = ~I am in love, Gavin, but he is no fool.~
@1007 = ~No, Gavin. I am sorry.~
@1008 = ~Yes! <CHARNAME>, I am in love with you! I have told myself a thousand times that the time is not yet right, and given myself a hundred reasons why I should wait, but I can no longer contain my feelings for you.~
@1009 = ~<CHARNAME>, beloved, I cannot go on with this in my heart any longer. The time we have spent until now has been the sweetest torture, the most delightful agony of uncertainty! From the moment I became aware of my growing affection for you, I have lived under the shadow that you do not return my feelings. Now, those feelings consume me, and I can live with that uncertainty no longer. I must declare my love for you, my devotion to you, openly before the world.~
@1010 = ~If you will have me, I am yours. Will you marry me?~
@1011 = ~Yes!~
@1012 = ~Gavin, I am... overwhelmed. I need some time to think about this.~
@1013 = ~Gavin, I am sorry, but my feelings for you do not go beyond friendship. I wish they did, but they do not.~
@1014 = ~Sweet <CHARNAME>, I am surely the happiest of men! I don't know whether to laugh or weep or sing! Maybe not sing.~
@1015 = ~*embracing you and kissing your lips* My heart is too full for sleep. I will sit here by your side while you rest, and count the many, many reasons why I adore you.~
@1016 = ~I... understand. Please, sleep on it then. I had hoped that you... I thought you might have anticipated my intentions, but I see I was mistaken.~
@1017 = ~*strokes your cheek* I do not think I will sleep, but I will not keep you awake with my restlessness. I think I will walk a while, and be back before you wake.~
@1018 = ~*sad smile* I knew the risk before I spoke. I wish things might have been different, but at least the uncertainty is over.~
@1019 = ~Rest, sweet <CHARNAME>, and from the hour you awaken, I will content myself with your friendship.~
@1020 = ~You are? I hardly dared hope... but you did not say whom you love... <CHARNAME>, I am in love with you! I have told myself a thousand times that the time is not yet right, and given myself a hundred reasons why I should wait, but I can no longer contain my feelings for you.~
@1021 = ~<CHARNAME>, beloved, I can not go on with this in my heart any longer. The time we have spent until now has been the sweetest torture, the most delightful agony of uncertainty! From the moment I became aware of my growing affection for you, I have lived under the shadow that you do not return my feelings. Now, those feelings consume me, and I can live with that uncertainty no longer. I must declare my love for you, my devotion to you, openly before the world.~
@1022 = ~Gavin, I am sorry. I am in love, but not with you. My feelings for you do not go beyond friendship. I wish they did, but they do not.~
@1023 = ~I am sorry... I don't know what to say. I had hoped... but nevermind. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>. I think I will walk a while. I'll be back before you awaken.~
@1024 = ~Then he was the loser. Do you think you could ever... feel love for a poor, clumsy fool of a man?~
@1025 = ~You *voice breaks*... You are? Are you sure?~
@1026 = ~I am.~
@1027 = ~I believe that I am.~

@1029 = ~Ah... Do you think you could ever... feel love for a poor, clumsy fool of a man?~
@1030 = ~*When you wake, Gavin is seated beside you. As soon as you stir, he is instantly attentive.*~
@1031 = ~Good morning, beloved. I hope you slept well. I'm still too happy to know what hit me, but I'm in no hurry to regain my senses. I have a present for you. I meant to give it to you before, but with one thing and another, I forgot.~
@1032 = ~I hope you like the ring. Reed had it made, but she did the enchantment herself. Jolun's bar tab was not the only thing in the drawing tablet she gave me.~
@1033 = ~How did Reed know you intended to propose? You've been hinting for some time, but hardly seemed ready yourself, just now.~
@1034 = ~If I put this on, will I be able to take it off?~
@1035 = ~Has the entire Mor family conspired against me?~
@1036 = ~Gavin, I cannot accept this.~
@1037 = ~I've always been close to Reed. I had written to her, and told her how I felt about you, and that I was going to ask you to marry me. Everyone in the family had something to say about it. You can read the notes if you like.~
@1038 = ~Mum and Dad send their love and are anxious to meet you.~
@1039 = ~Gavin, this is a wonderful surprise.~
@1040 = ~Can I see what your family wrote?~
@1041 = ~I'm glad you think so. Mum and Dad send their love, and they can't wait to welcome you into the family.~
@1042 = ~I'm looking forward to it.~
@1043 = ~Can I read what they wrote?~
@1044 = ~Yes. She said so in her note. Is it acceptable to you?~
@1045 = ~Can I see what they wrote?~
@1046 = ~Not as such, no. But we are a close family, and they wish us well. They'll be happy to welcome you, when I introduce you as my intended.~
@1047 = ~I'm looking forward to that, as well.~
@1048 = ~Would you let me read what they wrote in the sketchbook?~
@1049 = ~Of course. Gordon's still trying to get me to come to work in his shop, and Della's an interfering old hen, but family is family. They all wish us well, and that's what's important.~
@1050 = ~I'd be happier if your family would stay out of our lives.~
@1051 = ~Is there any chance we can cut the apron strings? Your family does seem closer than many.~
@1052 = ~I'm looking forward to meeting your family, too.~
@1053 = ~It will probably take some getting used to, but I'm sure we'll be fine.~
@1054 = ~They live in Ulgoth's Beard, and they don't travel much, really. I'm sorry you don't think you can be close to my family, but I don't think we'll have to worry about too much interferance.~
@1055 = ~As long as we're together, that's all that matters.~
@1056 = ~As am I. I think you will get along well with my family. They will love you, of course, but that goes without saying.~
@1057 = ~I don't recall ever starting the day with so much joy in my heart. How amazing!~
@1058 = ~Why not? Is the ring not to your taste?~
@1059 = ~That isn't it, Gavin. I'm just not ready to marry you.~
@1060 = ~No. I don't really care for it.~
@1061 = ~It's too valuable.~
@1062 = ~On second though, never mind. The ring is beautiful, Gavin, and I'm happy to wear it.~
@1063 = ~Oh... That is horrible news! But you know your own mind. I have no choice but to release you, though it rends my heart.~
@1064 = ~The promise comes with the ring. The ring is yours to wear or not, as you see fit. I am sorry you do not like it, but you don't have to wear it if you don't want to. Your acceptance of it is all I need to know you love me.~
@1065 = ~Nothing is too valuable for you, beloved.~
@1066 = ~And my happiness is beyond measure!~
@1067 = ~*Gavin looks weary. The hours since you retired have done nothing to rejuvenate him.*~
@1068 = ~<CHARNAME>, I must know: will you have me or not?~
@1069 = ~Yes, Gavin, I will marry you. I just needed more time to make up my mind.~
@1070 = ~I am sorry, Gavin. I need more time still.~
@1071 = ~I am sorry, Gavin, but I must refuse your proposal. My feelings for you do no go beyond friendship.~
@1072 = ~Then you have made me a very happy man! I have a ring... I hope you like it.~
@1073 = ~Then I am sorry, too. There is no more time. It is a sad truth that a word may never be unsaid. I have confessed my love to you. There is nothing I can say that changes that. You have told me of your reservations. Nothing you can say would change that.~
@1074 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have lived with my love for you burning inside me for longer than I ever thought I could endure. I can bear it no longer. You will not have me. I must accept this, without hoping that just one more day will change your mind.~
@1075 = ~*sadly hangs his head* I knew this was a possible outcome when I confessed my love for you. Nevertheless, I had to try.~
@1076 = ~Would you walk with me, love?~
@1077 = ~I'm too tired, Gavin. Can we go for a walk another time?~
@1078 = ~Can we speak now, love?~
@1079 = ~I'm not going to be able to get out of this, am I?~
@1080 = ~No, beloved. Every day I spend in your company makes this burden harder to bear.~
@1081 = ~That sounds ominous. I suppose you should get it off your chest.~
@1082 = ~Gavin, I had no idea you were suffering! Speak, if it eases you!~
@1083 = ~Will you break our engagement if I ask you to leave it for later?~
@1084 = ~Gavin, I've had enough drama. I need sleep, and you need to control your emotions.~
@1085 = ~Thank you. There is nothing ominous about it, but I am suffering.~
@1086 = ~When you and I are together, I feel such love for you. The sound of your voice is the only music I wish to hear. The sparkle in your eyes bewitches me. Your very presence fills me with the most unbelievable happiness!~
@1087 = ~But that is not all... <CHARNAME>, I have said how you appeal to my heart and to my soul, and how much I crave your company for the delight of both, but...~
@1088 = ~<CHARNAME>, that is not the only way a man may desire a woman.~
@1089 = ~I know.~
@1090 = ~Thank you. Talking about this would be a mercy.~
@1091 = ~If my suffering means nothing to you, then yes, I will have no choice but to release you from our engagement.~
@1092 = ~Then I suppose you should get it off your chest.~
@1093 = ~If my suffering means nothing to you, then I have no choice but to release you from our engagement. I am sorry for keeping you from your rest.~
@1094 = ~Very well. I had hoped that I could ease my way into this discussion, but I don't want to delay your rest if you're exhausted.~
@1095 = ~Gavin, please, let me sleep! I promise to be as attentive as you like when we wake.~
@1096 = ~I'm tired, Gavin, but I'm not too tired to talk about something that means a lot to you.~
@1097 = ~All right... sleep well, love.~
@1098 = ~Thank you. This is going to be uncomfortable enough without having to worry about depriving you of sleep as well.~
@1099 = ~*gulp* A man may... <CHARNAME>, my love, I feel such a... need for you~
@1100 = ~*embrace him* Gavin, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.~
@1101 = ~Are you trying to tell me that you feel lust for me?~
@1102 = ~*flinches, but gives in to your embrace* I am... very aware... painfully aware... of your presence.~
@1103 = ~<CHARNAME>, forgive me, but I must ask you: have you ever... Gods, why must I be so damned hesitant?! You've said you'll marry me. We'll need to talk about it sooner or later!~
@1104 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you ever known the touch of a man?~
@1105 = ~What has that got to do with anything?~
@1106 = ~I don't want to tell you.~
@1107 = ~Nothing! I'm going to keep on loving you no matter what your answer. I'm just trying to find out whether or not you understand the nature of the desire I feel for you. And later, after we are wed... there are other considerations.~
@1108 = ~I am not going to answer you, but I understand that you are aroused. You have been before, on more than one occasion. Was that all this fuss was about?~
@1109 = ~In that case, yes, I have.~
@1110 = ~Oh. No, Gavin, I haven't.~
@1111 = ~I still do not want to answer you.~
@1112 = ~*relieved sigh* That is all I needed to know. Since you do understand, then you also understand how difficult it is for me to restrain myself until after we are married. My desire for you is great.~
@1113 = ~I do understand. I want you, too, but I can wait if you can.~
@1114 = ~I do understand. The idea of making love to you is a little frightening, so I am just as happy to wait until we are both ready for it.~
@1115 = ~I want you, too, Gavin. You don't have to wait, you know.~
@1116 = ~To be perfectly honest with you, the idea of making love to you is a little frightening, so I am just as happy to wait until we are both ready for it.~
@1117 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but I think your desire for me might be greater than mine is for you.~
@1118 = ~That is an encouraging thought! I cannot even tell you how much I appreciate your acceptance and understanding.~
@1119 = ~Thank you for soothing my fears. Sleep well, love.~
@1120 = ~When the time comes, I promise to be gentle. I think you already know that I would never force you to do anything you do not want to do. I cannot even tell you how much I appreciate your acceptance and understanding.~
@1121 = ~No, I do have to wait. We are not yet wed. But your eagerness is encouraging! I'm very happy you feel that way!~
@1122 = ~When the time comes, I promise to be gentle. I think you already know that I would never force you to do anything you do not want to do. But we are not yet wed. That decision can wait.~
@1123 = ~Thank you for letting me unburden myself. Sleep well, love.~
@1124 = ~I hardly see how it could be otherwise. I think you already know that I would never force you to do anything you do not want to do. I will strive to be a gentle and considerate lover always. But we are not yet wed. That decision can wait.~
@1125 = ~*relieved sigh* That is all I needed to know, and it changes nothing between us. Since you do understand, then you also understand how difficult it is for me to restrain myself until after we are married. My desire for you is great.~
@1126 = ~*relieved sigh* That is all I needed to know. Your answer changes nothing between us, save that now I know that I must be careful lest I drive you away with my... eagerness. Since you do understand, then you also understand how difficult it is for me to restrain myself until after we are married. My desire for you is great.~
@1127 = ~You do not need to tell me. Your answer changes nothing between us, but I will have to be careful lest my... eagerness frighten you. The feelings I have for you stir my blood. How I yearn to make love to you! It is difficult for me to restrain myself until after we are married. My desire for you is great.~
@1128 = ~*relieved sigh* That is all I needed to know, and it changes nothing between us. Since you have some understanding of my need, then you also understand how difficult it is for me to restrain myself until after we are married. My desire for you is great.~
@1129 = ~Your answer changes nothing between us, but I will have to be careful lest my... eagerness frighten you. The feelings I have for you stir my blood. How I yearn to make love to you! It is difficult for me to restrain myself until after we are married. My desire for you is great.~
@1130 = ~My feelings for you would be no different one way or the other! I'm going to keep on loving you no matter what your answer. I'm just trying to find out whether or not you understand the nature of the desire I feel for you. And later, after we are wed... there are other considerations.~
@1131 = ~Yes! I yearn for you! I am half mad with desire for you! <CHARNAME>, forgive me, but I must ask you: have you ever... Gods, why must I be so damned hesitant?! You've said you'll marry me. We'll need to talk about it sooner or later!~
@1132 = ~*gulp* You do? <CHARNAME>, my love, I feel such a... need for you~
@1133 = ~May I make an odd request of you, love?~
@1134 = ~You may ask me anything, Gavin.~
@1135 = ~Is it important?~
@1136 = ~Can it wait?~
@1137 = ~*smile* Thanks. We are about to retire, and I was wondering if you would let me hold you while we sleep.~
@1138 = ~Are you sure that is a good idea? You know how hard it is for you to resist temptation.~
@1139 = ~Why would you want to do that?~
@1140 = ~I would like that.~
@1141 = ~Have you changed your mind about becoming lovers?~
@1142 = ~I would rather wait for that until after we are married.~
@1143 = ~It is an important question, but you do not have to agree to it. We are about to retire, and I was wondering if you would let me hold you while we sleep.~
@1144 = ~It is a quick question, and you do not have to agree. We are about to retire, and I was wondering if you would let me hold you while we sleep.~
@1145 = ~Yes, I know. But I think I can control myself, and sleeping violates no vows. Our lives are uncertain. If something were to happen to either of us, I would at least like to be able to treasure the memory of waking up in your arms.~
@1146 = ~Then you shall have your wish.~
@1147 = ~I would prefer to wait. I think we will survive to be wed.~
@1148 = ~Because our lives are uncertain, and sleeping violates no vows. If something were to happen to either of us, I would at least like to be able to treasure the memory of waking up in your arms.~
@1149 = ~I am happy to hear you say that. Our lives are uncertain. If something were to happen to either of us, I would at least like to be able to treasure the memory of waking up in your arms.~
@1150 = ~On second thought, I would prefer to wait. I think we will survive to be wed.~
@1151 = ~No, but I think I can control myself, and sleeping violates no vows. Our lives are uncertain. If something were to happen to either of us, I would at least like to be able to treasure the memory of waking up in your arms.~
@1152 = ~I understand, but I think I can control myself, and sleeping violates no vows. Our lives are uncertain. If something were to happen to either of us, I would at least like to be able to treasure the memory of waking up in your arms.~
@1153 = ~As you wish. Should you change your mind, just let me know.~
@1154 = ~Thank you, my love.~
@1155 = ~*Gavin follows you when you rise to retire. He shows an uncharacteristic lack of self-consciousness as he strips down to his undergarments and slips under the blankets.*~
@1156 = ~*Remove your outer garments as well and join him.*~
@1157 = ~*Remain fully clothed, but join him.*~
@1158 = ~*Remain fully clothed and wrap yourself in another blanket before lying down just close enough to kiss him goodnight.*~
@1159 = ~*He wraps one arm around you and seeks your lips for a goodnight kiss. Your lips touch briefly, then part. He sighs contentedly, and draws your body closer to his.*~
@1160 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@1161 = ~*Gavin seeks your kiss again, more urgently.*~
@1162 = ~Gavin! You said you only wanted to sleep.~
@1163 = ~*Return his kiss.*~
@1164 = ~*groans* I did. Forgive me, beloved. Your touch sets my blood afire, but I must be stronger than this.~
@1165 = ~*Gavin moans softly and kisses you again, even more passionately.*~
@1166 = ~Gods... how I yearn for you!~
@1167 = ~*Say nothing, but slide your hand up under his shirt.*~
@1168 = ~Gavin, you vowed chastity before marriage!~
@1169 = ~Gods, I did! And I am coming dangerously close to breaking that vow. I will wrap myself in separate blankets. That way I can still wake beside you, but I will not be tempted.~
@1170 = ~*Gavin startles at the touch of your hand on his ribs, but he does not stop kissing you. His own hands shake as they move over your body. At first, he seems content to caress your shoulder and arm, but his confidence grows with his passion. He strokes your breast, then abruptly stops himself.*~
@1171 = ~<CHARNAME>... my vows...~
@1172 = ~You swore you would abstain with a woman you were not *prepared* to wed. Gavin, you have already promised to marry me, so you would not be breaking your oath if we became lovers.~
@1173 = ~Yes. You must stop.~
@1174 = ~I must! By Lathander's golden majesty, I hunger for you. I had thought myself strong enough to lie beside you and leave you unmolested, but I am weakening. I promised I would not lie with a woman I was not prepared to wed...~
@1175 = ~Then you should sleep elsewhere.~
@1176 = ~But you are prepared to wed me! We are engaged!~
@1177 = ~Yes. I will wrap myself in separate blankets. That way I can still wake beside you, but I will not be tempted.~
@1178 = ~That is true, my love! I am prepared to marry you. And you have consented to become my wife. Will you... Would you also consent to become my lover?~
@1179 = ~I would still prefer to wait until we are married.~
@1180 = ~Then I will gladly wait, and give thanks for your love and your understanding.~
@1181 = ~Then let us learn together the ways of lovers.~
@1182 = ~*groans* Your touch sets my blood afire, but I must be stronger than this.~
@1183 = ~*Gavin seems to have mistaken your reserve for physical coldness. He gently unwraps the blanket and drapes it over you both. He wraps one arm around you and seeks your lips for a goodnight kiss. Your lips touch briefly, then part. He sighs contentedly, and draws your body closer to his.*~
@1184 = ~*You wake to find Gavin seated beside you.*~
@1185 = ~What in the nine hells are you doing here?!~
@1186 = ~Hello, Gavin. Did you sleep at all?~
@1187 = ~Do you have any idea how unsettling it is to wake up and find someone staring at you?~
@1188 = ~Hmmmf. Is there coffee?~
@1189 = ~If I'm not able to wake beside you, at least I can watch you wake.~
@1190 = ~You're a strange man, Gavin, if you'd wake up early just to watch me drool.~
@1191 = ~I still feel like you've invaded my privacy.~
@1192 = ~Do you really like watching me sleep?~
@1193 = ~I thought clerics of Lathander worshiped the sunrise.~
@1194 = ~Some, but I rose early to watch you wake.~
@1195 = ~I feel like you've invaded my privacy.~
@1196 = ~I apologize. It was selfishness on my part. Seeing your face in repose brings me comfort. When your face is still, I believe that all is right with the world. When your eyes open and fill with light, I am stricken with the most exquisite... pang, as if I alone have beheld the primeval dawn.~
@1197 = ~You blaspheme, cleric!~
@1198 = ~How poetic.~
@1199 = ~Do you stalk me, that you would creep in on me while I sleep?~
@1200 = ~Are you troubled?~
@1201 = ~There is, love. I'll bring it to you.~
@1202 = ~Hardly! Seeing your face in repose brings me comfort. When your face is still, I believe that all is right with the world. When your eyes open and fill with light, I am stricken with the most exquisite... pang, as if I alone have beheld the primeval dawn.~
@1203 = ~I apologize. That was not my intent. Seeing your face in repose brings me comfort. When your face is still, I believe that all is right with the world. When your eyes open and fill with light, I am stricken with the most exquisite... pang, as if I alone have beheld the primeval dawn.~
@1204 = ~I do. Seeing your face in repose brings me comfort. When your face is still, I believe that all is right with the world. When your eyes open and fill with light, I am stricken with the most exquisite... pang, as if I alone have beheld the primeval dawn.~
@1205 = ~I fear I need more focus before I can concentrate as I should. Seeing your face in repose brings me comfort. When your face is still, I believe that all is right with the world. When your eyes open and fill with light, I am stricken with the most exquisite... pang, as if I alone have beheld the primeval dawn.~
@1206 = ~I do not. My soul is owed to Lathander, and will return to him on my death. Until then, it is yours.~
@1207 = ~Loving you does not lessen my faith in any way. You taught me the true value of spiritual renewal when you taught my tired heart to love you.~
@1208 = ~If it is poetry, then it is the poetry of rebirth. It was you that taught me the true value of spiritual renewal when you taught my tired heart to love you.~
@1209 = ~Never! I had no idea I was so unwelcome by your side! Should I leave you?~
@1210 = ~No, Gavin, but next time, please wait for an invitation to my bedside.~
@1211 = ~Yes, Gavin. I do not wish you to share my bed before we are married.~
@1212 = ~Gavin, your intensity frightens me. I want to end our engagement.~
@1213 = ~Not when I look at you, I'm not.~
@1214 = ~Ah, yes. Of course!~
@1215 = ~I apologize. I will... curb my enthusiasm as well as I am able.~
@1216 = ~A future without you is desolate, but I have no choice but to honor your wishes. I release you from our engagement.~
@1217 = ~*You wake to find Gavin still sleeping beside you.*~
@1218 = ~*Gavin's arms still encircle you, and his features are serene.*~
@1219 = ~*You let him sleep.*~
@1220 = ~Time to rise, Gavin.~
@1221 = ~*he wakes as he senses your movement* Good morning, dear one. I thought I was dreaming, but here you are... here we are... I must be dreaming!~
@1222 = ~I hope you... have no regrets...~
@1223 = ~None. You were as gentle and considerate as I could have wished.~
@1224 = ~None. You were a gentle, considerate, and thorough lover, and I could have asked for no more.~
@1225 = ~I was afraid, Gavin! I was afraid of your passion, afraid of you. I had not realized our union would be so intense.~
@1226 = ~I was afraid, Gavin! I was afraid of your passion, afraid of you. I had not realized our union would be so intense, or so painful.~
@1227 = ~I regret that you were so inexpereinced. You acted as if you've never touched a woman before! I would have prefered to have offered the gift of my virtue to a more skillful partner, who might have made better use of it.~
@1228 = ~I regret that you were so inexperienced. You acted as if you've never touched a woman before! If I would bind myself to a man, I would prefer one more skilled in the ways of pleasing a woman.~
@1229 = ~Gavin, I can't get past the fear and the pain. I do not want to do that again.~
@1230 = ~Did you just ask me if I enjoyed making love to you?~
@1231 = ~I did not expect it to be so ordinary. The world is the same. My life has not changed. No mysteries have been revealed. Was something else supposed to happen?~
@1232 = ~Good morning, dear one. I thought I was dreaming, but here you are... here we are... I must be dreaming!~
@1233 = ~I regret that you were so inexperienced. You acted as if you've never touched a woman before! If I would bind myself to a man, I would prefer one more skilled in the ways to please a woman.~
@1234 = ~Oh, beloved <CHARNAME>, I am too full of joy to tell you how happy I am! Our love unites our hearts and our spirits, but I am glad we have found a new way to share it.~
@1235 = ~I wouldn't mind sharing our love that way again.~
@1236 = ~You don't have any regrets, either? I know you had reservations.~
@1237 = ~If we want to "share our love" that way again, we had better prepare for it, next time.~
@1238 = ~You really are excited about this, aren't you?~
@1239 = ~Neither would I, my love. Shall we stay a little longer?~
@1240 = ~That sounds like a wonderful idea.~
@1241 = ~Hadn't we better prepare for it a little better this time?~
@1242 = ~As much as I would like to linger, I think that we should continue our journey. Our quest doesn't wait for love.~
@1243 = ~As always, I am at your command.~
@1244 = ~Then allow me to spend a moment with my medicine bag, and I am all yours.~
@1245 = ~You are right, of course, my love. But say the word, and I am at your command.~
@1246 = ~None whatsoever. My oath of chastity depended on the promise to marry, not the ceremony itself. Your love has cured me of any misgivings.~
@1247 = ~Ah, yes. I am an idiot. I have my medicine bag right here. Oh well, we'll be ready, next time.~
@1248 = ~I am, my level-headed beauty. I have found the companion of my heart and nothing will dampen my good humor.~
@1249 = ~Oh, my beloved <CHARNAME>, I am sorry that was so unpleasant for you! The only excuse I can offer is that I was blinded by my eagerness. I will do everything I can to make it up to you next time, if you will allow it.~
@1250 = ~Everyone deserves a second chance.~
@1251 = ~Don't you have any regrets? I know you had reservations earlier.~
@1252 = ~I will allow you to try again to please me, but we had better prepare for it.~
@1253 = ~Gavin, I never want to do that again.~
@1254 = ~Then let us linger here a while, and I will try not to... fail you again.~
@1255 = ~No. My oath of chastity depended on the promise to marry, not the ceremony itself. The arguments you gave put my reservations to rest. My only regret was that I failed to please you. I will do better next time, if you will allow it.~
@1256 = ~Then allow me to spend a moment with my medicine bag, and I will do my best not to... fail you again.~
@1257 = ~Oh, my beloved <CHARNAME>, I am sorry that was so disappointing for you! The only excuse I can offer is that I was blinded by my eagerness. Please remember that the only time I ever... did that with a woman, it was to provide an excuse for the consequences of another's actions, and she cared little how I managed it. I can learn how to please you, if you will allow it.~
@1258 = ~I will allow you to try again, but we had better prepare for it.~
@1259 = ~I am deeply sorry for making that so unpleasant for you. I was too eager, too selfish...~
@1260 = ~For the sake of the family you one day hope to have, I hope you will reconsider someday.~
@1261 = ~For the sake of the love I bear you, I hope you will reconsider someday. Marriage without intimacy is rarely satisfying for either husband or wife.~
@1262 = ~Not that I know of, but I am no expert on these matters. We are closer now than we were before, or at least I feel closer to you, or would if you didn't ask such disturbing questions. I sense that our union was less special for you than it was for me. Did you not enjoy it?~
@1263 = ~No, I did.~
@1264 = ~Not really, no.~
@1265 = ~Why would you ask that?~
@1266 = ~That is not how I would have phrased it, but yes, I did, in a way.~
@1267 = ~I did.~
@1268 = ~Then I am glad, my perceptive and outspoken beauty..~
@1269 = ~Then I am sorry. If you would permit me, I would try again... when you are ready.~
@1270 = ~Because I love you, and I want you to be happy. But also because I fear that I might have been too... eager. I did not want to overwhelm you, but the passion that moved me was beyond any control of mine. Part of it was my love for you, but part of it was just the physical need of a man who has long been denied such tender caresses. I will apologize for the second, but not the first.~
@1271 = ~You were fine.~
@1272 = ~It did leave something to be desired.~
@1273 = ~*His arms still encircle you, and his features are serene.*~
@1274 = ~*waking at your movement* Good morning, dear one. Did you sleep well?~
@1275 = ~Yes. I enjoyed sleeping in your embrace.~
@1276 = ~Yes, thanks.~
@1277 = ~Not really. I am not used to sharing my bed.~
@1278 = ~Not really. I kept worrying that you would assault me while I slept.~
@1279 = ~*grins* Then we shall do it from now on. I liked it very much, too. But come. It is time to face the <DAYNIGHT>. I know with great certainty that I shall do so with a smile.~
@1280 = ~I am glad. I do not recall ever sleeping as well as I have by your side. But come. It is time to face the <DAYNIGHT>. I know with great certainty that I shall do so with a smile.~
@1281 = ~Oh. Well, I hope you can get used to it in time. But come. It is time to face the <DAYNIGHT>.~
@1282 = ~Never! I would never do something so wrong! <CHARNAME>, I love you, but I respect your virtue.~
@1283 = ~I can only hope you will come to trust me in time. But come. It is time to face the <DAYNIGHT>.~
@1284 = ~*grumbling a bit, but waking nonetheless* Good morning, dear one. Did you sleep well?~
@1285 = ~So, dear one, when shall we be wed?~
@1286 = ~Tomorrow sounds good.~
@1287 = ~In a year and a day.~
@1288 = ~Isn't it too soon to set a date?~
@1289 = ~I like being engaged, but I'm not sure I want to get married.~
@1290 = ~I'm having second thoughts about marrying you.~
@1291 = ~You are the impulsive one, aren't you, dearest? "Tomorrow" is a bit soon, don't you think?~
@1292 = ~Why not get married now?~
@1293 = ~Maybe you're right. When would you like to get married?~
@1294 = ~You aren't backing out on me, are you?~
@1295 = ~Not at all! And tomorrow, I'll say "tomorrow," and so it goes.~
@1296 = ~Because your quest is still unresolved. I would like to be married by another priest of Lathander, with my family present, and that's hard to arrange when we don't know where we'll be tomorrow. Our wedding is too important to squeeze in between two battles.~
@1297 = ~Are you trying to back out of your promise?~
@1298 = ~Oh. Did you have a better date in mind?~
@1299 = ~No, Gavin, tomorrow it must be, or as soon as we can get to the Song of the Morning Temple, if you insist that a priest of Lathander administer our vows.~
@1300 = ~Gavin, I don't want to wait another day!~
@1301 = ~Gods, no! If your quest were done, a Dawnbringer on hand, and my family assembled, I would have agreed most heartily! I did have a rough idea in mind. Would you like to hear it?~
@1302 = ~All right, then.~
@1303 = ~This had better be good.~
@1304 = ~Are you sure this isn't just a convenient way to back out of your promise to marry me?~
@1305 = ~Are you sure this isn't just a convenient way to back out of your promise to marry me? You broke your vow of chastity easily enough.~
@1306 = ~I think we should wait six months. If your quest has not been concluded by then, we should send word to my family and plan to be married three months after that. Our marriage would take place three months after your quest is done, or in nine months, whichever comes first. Is this acceptable to you?~
@1307 = ~*kisses you* I can hardly wait to be able to call myself your husband, my lovely bride.~
@1308 = ~Compromise is a big part of marriage. I guess it's best to get used to it now. What did you have in mind?~
@1309 = ~As soon as we can get to a temple. Gavin, I simply will not wait. You weasel out of promises too easily.~
@1310 = ~As soon as we can get to a temple. Gavin, your vow of chastity is hard to bear.~
@1311 = ~As soon as we can get to a temple. I love you too much to wait!~
@1312 = ~Three months from now.~
@1313 = ~I guess your idea is all right after all.~
@1314 = ~Is *that* what this is about?! <CHARNAME>, I broke no vow when you and I lay together.~
@1315 = ~I made that promise to avoid mistaking desire for love. I loved you before I ever even kissed you. I asked you to marry me because I want to be your husband, not because it allowed me to sidestep an inconvenient oath. Had you refused my advances, I would have loved you no less!~
@1316 = ~Now that we have become lovers, my desire to bind myself to you forever has only grown, not diminished! Were I a rash man, I would have brought you to the altar already, but common sense demands that we wait a little while.~
@1317 = ~What proof of my constancy can I offer that will satisfy you?~
@1318 = ~None. Gavin, you offer me clever excuses for an oath you broke, nothing more. You make promises too easily and too often for my comfort.~
@1319 = ~Time. Let us delay our marriage until I am satisfied that you can be faithful to me even without a solemn vow.~
@1320 = ~I would hold something of yours in trust against the fulfilment of your promise. Give me the one thing that you value above all others to keep until we are wed.~
@1321 = ~I am satisfied. You have been honest with me thus far. I would repay you poorly to doubt you now.~
@1322 = ~Have I lost your love? Have I wooed you only to lose you?~
@1323 = ~Yes. It is over, Gavin.~
@1324 = ~No. I still love you. But I do not believe you will wed me.~
@1325 = ~If that is your decision, I am sorry. I would have married you.~
@1326 = ~Then give me time to prove that I will. This is too important to rush, but the wait is hard for me, too.~
@1327 = ~You shall find no reason to doubt either my love or my constancy. Take all the time you need. I have offered you my life. I would prefer to spend it at your side as your husband, but you may do with it what you will.~
@1328 = ~What would you have of me? Name it, and it is yours. I withold only my ring, because I cannot remove it.~
@1329 = ~Let me choose from among your other possessions, then.~
@1330 = ~You don't have anything whose value equals the promise you made.~
@1331 = ~I know you, Gavin. Your possessions mean nothing to you, except for that ring. Nothing else will do.~
@1332 = ~Please do! They are all yours anyway.~
@1333 = ~Of course not! That is what I was trying to tell you! Your love is the most important thing I possess, and if I lose that, I have lost all! Give me time, beloved. Let me prove my love to you every day for the rest of my life. I cherish each and every moment, and I would not squander them needlessly. I am eager to be married to you myself, but our situation demands that we wait. Please understand that.~
@1334 = ~The only way that ring is coming off is if my finger comes off with it. I can't remove the enchantment, nor can you. Is that really what you want?~
@1335 = ~Something else, then. I will choose from among your other possessions.~
@1336 = ~You have nothing else worth the promise you made.~
@1337 = ~Would you really cut off your own finger to please me?~
@1338 = ~I believe you. You don't need to go that far. I will wait.~
@1339 = ~Prove it.~
@1340 = ~Thank the gods! I will not disappoint you!~
@1341 = ~*gulp* As you wish.~
@1342 = ~*remain silent*~
@1343 = ~What are you doing with that axe? That's the one we use for firewood.~
@1344 = ~*THUNK* Gah!~
@1345 = ~Your... ring.~
@1346 = ~Gavin! Your finger is still inside it!~
@1347 = ~Gavin... I don't know what to say... I didn't think you would actually do it.~
@1348 = ~You just cut off your own finger! I feel ill.~
@1349 = ~Get that horrible thing away from me!~
@1350 = ~I said it wouldn't come off. Have to pull myself together. Leave me alone a while, all right?~
@1351 = ~I never bluff. Have to pull myself together. Leave me alone a while, all right?~
@1352 = ~Me, too. Have to pull myself together. Leave me alone a while, all right?~
@1353 = ~You asked for it. I never bluff. Have to pull myself together. Leave me alone a while, all right?~
@1354 = ~You're welcome. Have to pull myself together. Leave me alone a while, all right?~
@1355 = ~You don't expect me to use my eating knife, do you? That would take all day, and I'd never get through the bone with it.~
@1356 = ~Oh.~
@1357 = ~You're actually going to go through with it, aren't you?~
@1358 = ~Good thinking.~
@1359 = ~Stop! I believe you! Don't do it!~
@1360 = ~Of course. I never bluff.~
@1361 = ~Thank you! I was not looking forward to that!~
@1362 = ~Thank you, beloved.~
@1363 = ~Oh, is *that* what this is about?! You should have said!~
@1364 = ~I've been doing a lot of thinking about that vow. Hardly surprising, really. The exact wording was that I would not sleep with any woman I had not promised to marry. I clearly intend to marry you. We are already engaged! I never said that I was opposed to intimacy before marriage, for myself or anyone else.~
@1365 = ~If your haste to be wed is solely based on my... restrictions, I would be more than happy to put you at ease.~
@1366 = ~Gavin, you offer me clever excuses for an oath you intend to break, nothing more. You make promises too easily and too often for my comfort.~
@1367 = ~Are you certain? An oath is a serious thing, you know.~
@1368 = ~Are you saying that you and I could become lovers?~
@1369 = ~What are we waiting for?!~
@1370 = ~I would still prefer to remain chaste until after the wedding.~
@1371 = ~Absolutely. I made that promise to avoid mistaking desire for love. I loved you before I ever even kissed you. I asked you to marry me because I want to be your husband, not because it would allow me to sidestep an inconvenient oath. You can always refuse, and I will love you no less!~
@1372 = ~Do you require any further proof of my constancy?~
@1373 = ~Yes! Gavin, you offer me clever excuses for an oath you intend to break, nothing more. You make promises too easily and too often for my comfort.~
@1374 = ~Time. Let us delay our marriage *and* intimacy until I am satisfied that you can be faithful to me even without a solemn vow.~
@1375 = ~If you are willing, but that... discussion will wait until we have some more privacy.~
@1376 = ~A little more privacy, nothing more! How I yearn for you! I will seek you out when we retire, my love.~
@1377 = ~Then I will wait patiently for as long as you need.~
@1378 = ~Dearest, my love for you is boundless, but we still must wait! Are you afraid that our love will fade if we are not married immediately?~
@1379 = ~No, but I am afraid that you will try to weasel out of your promise. You do that far too easily.~
@1380 = ~Then fear no longer! I love you to the core of my soul. I will not leave you. All I ask is that you allow me to prove it.~
@1381 = ~There's my sensible beauty! I love you to the core of my soul. You know I'd never leave you. All I ask is that you allow me to prove it.~
@1382 = ~Three months is barely enough time to assemble my family, and leaves us no time to finish your quest! I would not leave it unfinished!~
@1383 = ~I have every reason to think you will find it acceptable.~
@1384 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have given you no reason to doubt me. Are you afraid that our love will fade if we are not married immediately?~
@1385 = ~No, but I am afraid that your desire to wed me springs from your desire to escape your vow of chastity.~
@1386 = ~That leaves us no time to assemble my family or to finish your quest! I would not leave it unfinished!~
@1387 = ~No, but I am finding your oath of chastity hard to bear.~
@1388 = ~Neither do I! If your quest were done, a Dawnbringer on hand, and my family assembled, I would have agreed most heartily! I did have a rough idea in mind. Would you like to hear it?~
@1389 = ~You do not wish to marry at all, do you?~
@1390 = ~No, I do want to marry you, just not yet.~
@1391 = ~No, I wanted to be engaged to you, but I do not really want to marry you.~
@1392 = ~I thought I did, but I'm having second thoughts.~
@1393 = ~Then I will wait. Love is patient.~
@1394 = ~Ah. I understand. You crave the adoration of another while your own heart remains free.~
@1395 = ~Maybe you are not as different from Miranda as I had thought.~
@1396 = ~I do not wish to break our engagement unless you are certain that you do not want to marry me. Is our love dead, or do you just need more time to think?~
@1397 = ~I need more time to think.~
@1398 = ~It is over.~
@1399 = ~Fair enough!~
@1400 = ~I guess it is, but I am growing impatient to marry you.~
@1401 = ~Did you have a date in mind?~
@1402 = ~Why are you so impatient?~
@1403 = ~I know what you mean. Your vow of chastity is hard to bear.~
@1404 = ~Actually, I'm having second thoughts.~
@1405 = ~Because I love you, and I want to be your husband. No other reason.~
@1406 = ~*kisses you* Come on. If we stand around any longer talking about our marriage, I'm going to start having inappropriate thoughts!~
@1407 = ~Have you given any thought to where you would like to live once this is all over?~
@1408 = ~You liked living in Beregost, didn't you? We could always live there.~
@1409 = ~Where were you planning on sending Lanie to school? I imagine you'd like to live nearby.~
@1410 = ~I don't know if I'll ever settle down long enough to call any place home.~
@1411 = ~I want to go back to Candlekeep. I miss my studies.~
@1412 = ~Somewhere exotic, and very far from here. How about Calimport?~
@1413 = ~I want to live in a big city, as different from Candlekeep as possible. How about Waterdeep?~
@1414 = ~It doesn't matter, Gavin, as long as I'm with you.~
@1415 = ~Why don't we decide that when the time comes.~
@1416 = ~How about Ulgoth's Beard? You've got family there.~
@1417 = ~Can we talk about where we're going to live now?~
@1418 = ~Certainly, but we're going to have to decide sooner or later.~
@1419 = ~I did like living in Beregost, but that part of my life is over. I'd rather live somewhere I've never lived before, but somewhere close to Baldur's Gate. I was planning to send Lanie to school at the Temple of Oghma there, and I'd like to be close to her.~
@1420 = ~How about we live in Baldur's Gate itself? You'd be able to be near Lanie, and I'd get to live in a busy city.~
@1421 = ~How about Candlekeep, then. You'd be close enough to visit Lanie, but not so close that you'd stifle her education, and I'd be able to pursue my own studies.~
@1422 = ~Maybe Ulgoth's Beard? You'd be near your family, and it isn't that far from Baldur's Gate.~
@1423 = ~I'd still like to live in Beregost. You do own a house there already, don't you?~
@1424 = ~That sounds wonderful, <CHARNAME>. I'd be happy anywhere as long as you're there, but it's important that Lanie understand that her father has not abandoned her, even if we can't always be together. Thank you for being so understanding.~
@1425 = ~Compromise is always a good solution. You are so clever!~
@1426 = ~I've got family everywhere, it seems, as the Mors always seem to have had large families, but if you'd like to live there, I have no objection.~
@1427 = ~Not anymore. I gave the house to Miranda. I wouldn't want to live there anyway: too many bad memories. But if you'd like to live in Beregost, we can live on the other side of town.~
@1428 = ~You are very perceptive. That was part of why I was asking. I was planning on sending Lanie to school at the Temple of Oghma in Baldur's Gate.~
@1429 = ~Well, we're going to need to live somewhere. I've got Lanie to think about. I understand if you want to travel more, and there are times I'm going to be able to accompany you, but a child needs stability.~
@1430 = ~And there's our own family to think about. You've said you want children. Still, I don't think there's any point in arguing about it now. There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.~
@1431 = ~Even if Lanie is enough family for you, she's always going to be part of our plans. But I suppose we can think about that later.~
@1432 = ~That would work out well! You could pursue your studies to your heart's content, and I could be near Lanie. I'm planning on sending her to school at the Temple of Oghma in Baldur's Gate.~
@1433 = ~Nowhere is "exotic" after you've lived there a while. I don't want to live too far from Baldur's Gate. I was planning on sending Lanie to school at the temple of Oghma there.~
@1434 = ~If you've got your heart set on Calimport, I hope you would be content to postpone the move long enough to see if there is somewhere in that city for Lanie to get her education.~
@1435 = ~Waterdeep wouldn't be too bad. I was hoping for Baldur's Gate, myself, because that's where I wanted to send Lanie to school, and I don't want to be too far from her. But I'm sure that a place like Waterdeep is bound to have somewhere a gifted child can get an education.~
@1436 = ~Do you have any idea how wonderful you are? I feel much the same way about you. But I do have a slight preference for Baldur's Gate. I wanted to send Lanie to school there, and I don't want to be too far from her. I am delighted that is acceptable to you!~
@1437 = ~I'll be willing to call anywhere "home" if you are there, but I've got Lanie to think about, too. I'm not saying we should decide now! I'm just saying that I plan to send her to school in Baldur's Gate, and I'd like to live nearby. But these decisions can wait.~
@1438 = ~I've got family everywhere! The Mors have always had big families. Did you really want to live in Ulgoth's Beard, or were you just saying that to please me?~
@1439 = ~I really want to live in Ulgoth's Beard.~
@1440 = ~I thought it would please you.~
@1441 = ~If you want Ulgoth's Beard, then Ulgoth's Beard it shall be. It's close enough to Baldur's Gate that I can still be near Lanie. I was planning on sending her to school there. And that would give you a chance to get to know my family.~
@1442 = ~That is very sweet of you, but Baldur's Gate would please me more. I was planning to send Lanie to school there, and I want to be close to her. But we can work out the details when the time comes. The important part is that we're going to be together.~
@1443 = ~*When you wake, you feel something warm lying beside you.*~
@1444 = ~*You open your eyes to see Gavin propped on one elbow at your side, his brown eyes studying your face. When he realizes you are awake, he strokes your cheek.*~
@1445 = ~What, no breakfast today?~
@1446 = ~Is something wrong?~
@1447 = ~Good morning, Gavin.~
@1448 = ~Well, this is a nice surprise!~
@1449 = ~There will be breakfast, but I wanted to lie beside you for a while this morning.~
@1450 = ~Fair enough. You've earned a rest.~
@1451 = ~So get up, Gavin! You always cook breakfast, and I'm in favor of keeping the tradition.~
@1452 = ~Why so affectionate this morning? You're always up long before I am.~
@1453 = ~Nothing I can name. I feel an expectant hush, as if the world were holding its breath.~
@1454 = ~I am uneasy, and I thought looking on your beauty while you slept would comfort me, as it has so often in the past, but my unrest has not lessened.~
@1455 = ~*wrap your arms aroung him and hold him in silence*~
@1456 = ~Would talking about it help?~
@1457 = ~Maybe you would feel better if you started making breakfast.~
@1458 = ~If the world draws breath, it will let it out again. Don't worry, Gavin.~
@1459 = ~I wish it was. I feel an expectant hush, as if the world were holding its breath.~
@1460 = ~I am uneasy, although I cannot say why, and I thought looking on your beauty while you slept would comfort me, as it has so often in the past, but my unrest has not lessened.~
@1461 = ~It's no surprise for me. I look on you every morning, before I rise to pray. So often, just looking on your beauty while you sleep comforts me, but not this morning. I feel an expectant hush, as if the world were holding its breath. Not even your loveliness can dispell my anxiety.~
@1462 = ~I wish it was restful, but something is wrong. I feel an expectant hush, as if the world were holding its breath.~
@1463 = ~Maybe keeping to breakfast traditions will ease my worries. Gazing at you has not. I look on you every morning, before I rise to pray. So often, just looking on your beauty while you sleep comforts me, but not this morning. I feel an expectant hush, as if the world were holding its breath. Not even your loveliness can dispell my anxiety.~
@1464 = ~I am, but I'm having a hard time getting moving this time. I look on you every morning, before I rise to pray. So often, just looking on your beauty while you sleep comforts me, but not this morning. I feel an expectant hush, as if the world were holding its breath. Not even your loveliness can dispell my anxiety.~
@1465 = ~*embracing you completely* Thanks, but this isn't helping, either. There is something ahead that sleeping will not cure.~
@1466 = ~How about something more intimate than sleep?~
@1467 = ~Then we had best rise to face it.~
@1468 = ~Now you've got me worried!~
@1469 = ~For a Lathandrite to face a new day with fear in his heart is not reassuring.~
@1470 = ~Only one thing to do: make breakfast. I'll do it today.~
@1471 = ~It might, if I knew what to talk about. There is something ahead that talking won't cure, or sleeping, either.~
@1472 = ~How about something more intimate?~
@1473 = ~I suppose it's our only choice. Doing something is better than doing nothing, even if it's only making breakfast. Whatever today holds, we'll face it together.~
@1474 = ~But just in case: I love you, to the very depths of my soul.~
@1475 = ~You're probably right. It isn't as if worrying about it is going to help. Doing something is better than doing nothing, even if it's only making breakfast. Whatever today holds, we'll face it together.~
@1476 = ~You're right. Worrying about it is not going to help. Whatever today holds, we'll face it together.~
@1477 = ~Don't be! One of us is enough. Anyway, worrying about it is not going to help. Whatever today holds, we'll face it together.~
@1478 = ~We aren't immune to fear, you know. Anyway, worrying about it is not going to help. Whatever today holds, we'll face it together.~
@1479 = ~We'll both do it. Doing something is better than doing nothing, even if it's only making breakfast. Whatever today holds, we'll face it together.~
@1480 = ~I don't think I have it in me, but it isn't your fault. We'd best get moving. Whatever today holds, we'll face it together.~
@1481 = ~That letter... says your father is Bhaal, the god of murder!~
@1482 = ~And...~
@1483 = ~That's what it says, but I am having trouble believing it. You would have thought there would have been some hint before now!~
@1484 = ~Do you fear me because of it?~
@1485 = ~And just think of all the possibilities.~
@1486 = ~Does this change anything between us?~
@1487 = ~How can it not? You know I never cared much about one's parentage, but this is a little more serious than inheriting your father's nose or your mother's aptitude for music!~
@1488 = ~I am a cleric, after all. I know perfectly well what power the gods wield, and thinking about a mortal - and someone I love - imbued with that kind of power makes me feel sick!~
@1489 = ~You have the blood of a god in your veins, and not a benevolent god at that.~
@1490 = ~What are you trying to tell me?~
@1491 = ~I didn't ask for this, you know!~
@1492 = ~*And*?! And this is a little more serious than inheriting your father's nose or your mother's aptitude for music!~
@1493 = ~By Lathander's grace, I am his cleric. I know perfectly well what power the gods wield, and thinking about a mortal - and someone I love - imbued with that kind of power makes me feel sick!~
@1494 = ~I'm trying to tell you that you have to make a big decision, and it has nothing to do with my feelings for you. Unless you fight the evil in your blood, you could become a monster more horrible than anything I could imagine. Are you going to give in to the taint?~
@1495 = ~I don't see it as a taint. I see it as an opportunity. All the possibilities...~
@1496 = ~No! I will fight it, and keep doing what I know is right!~
@1497 = ~All the possibilities? Do you even understand the dark power that even now flows through your veins? Do you have any idea of the monster you could become?~
@1498 = ~I warn you, <CHARNAME>, I could never be party to that. Is that what you want?~
@1499 = ~No. I will fight it.~
@1500 = ~If that is what it takes to gain that kind of power, I welcome it!~
@1501 = ~Then I will help you gladly.~
@1502 = ~Then it is time for us to part company. I thought you were a better person than this. I am sorry.~
@1503 = ~I know that! Who would? But that isn't what's bothering me.~
@1504 = ~I know you have no control over who your father was. But the question is, now that you know what you are, what are you going to do with the knowledge?~
@1505 = ~I just don't know, Gavin.~
@1506 = ~I am still thinking about all the possibilities.~
@1507 = ~Whatever else, I am not going to become evil. I will do what I have to do to fight whatever taint I have inherited.~
@1508 = ~I hope you decide soon. You are not going to have long to make up your mind.~
@1509 = ~I have loved you honestly and truly, but if you surrender to the evil taint of your blood, as a servant of the Morning Lord, I must oppose you.~
@1510 = ~Please, beloved <CHARNAME>, for the sake of the love I bear you, do not give in to that taint.~
@1511 = ~What do you think the last several months have been?~
@1512 = ~Yes! I don't want to, but I fear what you might become.~
@1513 = ~<CHARNAME>, about what I said...~
@1514 = ~Can this wait, Gavin?~
@1515 = ~What?~
@1516 = ~Forget it, Gavin. You were upset.~
@1517 = ~We've all said things we don't mean.~
@1518 = ~Will you allow me to apologize for my inconsiderate behavior now?~
@1519 = ~Yes... of course.~
@1520 = ~You needed me to be supportive, and all I did was grill you. I'm sorry.~
@1521 = ~I'll get over it.~
@1522 = ~Is there a reason you lashed out at me like that?~
@1523 = ~You've forgiven me for things before.~
@1524 = ~You don't want to apologize. You want forgiveness. There is a difference.~
@1525 = ~I was, but I should not have reacted the way I did. I knew there was something special about you that had nothing to do with my affection for you. You can do things that ordinary people can't. The power had to come from somewhere.~
@1526 = ~But that isn't what this is about. You needed me to be supportive, and all I did was grill you. I'm sorry.~
@1527 = ~But I did mean it. I was overwhelmed, but I felt and still feel that you have a responsibility to avoid evil. But that isn't what this is about. You needed me to be supportive, and all I did was grill you. I'm sorry.~
@1528 = ~Thank Lathander!~
@1529 = ~I was frightened. I knew you were a powerful woman. That's one of the things I love about you. But I always thought of your power as more of an "inner strength" thing. The idea that you are powerful because your father is a god never would have dawned on me.~
@1530 = ~Are you telling me that the only reason I'm powerful is because my sire was Bhaal?~
@1531 = ~It never would have dawned on me, either.~
@1532 = ~You aren't improving your situation, Gavin.~
@1533 = ~What?!~
@1534 = ~But you never attacked me for what I was, or for something I have no control over.~
@1535 = ~Yes, there is. And I do need to be forgiven. I don't care who your father was, or why you have the powers you have. I know who and what you are, and what you do with your powers, and that is much more important.~
@1536 = ~I need you to forgive me for letting the shock of an unpleasant discovery overcome common sense. Forgivness heals a self-inflicted wound in the heart of the offender. I need that now.~
@1537 = ~You offended me, but your reaction was understandable. You are forgiven.~
@1538 = ~All right, but watch it in the future.~
@1539 = ~I'd like to see some grovelling, first.~
@1540 = ~Forget it. Gavin, you've overestimated my patience.~
@1541 = ~No! Gods, no! The reason you are powerful is because you are who you are, and all of who you are!~
@1542 = ~This is getting me nowhere. Let me try that again. I love you. You know this. I love you for what you are, a beautiful, powerful, kind, loving and lovable woman. The power you wield has many sources, but you use it to serve goodness.~
@1543 = ~Will you forgive me for being such a bastard when you needed me?~
@1544 = ~Why is it that you see things so much clearer when you step back and look at them?~
@1545 = ~But that isn't important. I love you for what you are, a beautiful, powerful, kind, loving and lovable woman. The power you wield has many sources, but you use it to serve goodness.~
@1546 = ~Gods, what am I saying?! The reason you are powerful is because you are who you are, and all of who you are!~
@1547 = ~That came out wrong! The reason you are powerful is because you are who you are, and all of who you are!~
@1548 = ~Thank you, love, for healing a wound I made myself.~
@1549 = ~Thank you for being so understanding.~
@1550 = ~*Gavin drops to his knees and bows face-down to the ground.*~
@1551 = ~It had to happen sooner or later. I'm sorry, love, I guess that's it.~
@1552 = ~*Gavin reaches for your feet with both outstretched hands, his nine fingers spread wide. He raises his face to meet your gaze.*~
@1553 = ~What more would you have of me?~
@1554 = ~Gavin, I... pushed too hard. I'm sorry.~
@1555 = ~You've done enough.~
@1556 = ~*Gavin reaches for your feet with both outstretched hands, as if he would kiss your boots.*~
@1557 = ~Am I forgiven?~
@1558 = ~Of course, Gavin. Perfectly understandable.~
@1559 = ~Of course.~
@1560 = ~Beloved, I must speak with you.~
@1561 = ~What is it, Gavin?~
@1562 = ~Why is everything so urgent?~
@1563 = ~My heart tells me that we are nearing the completion of your quest. Tomorrow is uncertain.~
@1564 = ~Tomorrow is always uncertain. Why is this any different?~
@1565 = ~Then we must make the most of today.~
@1566 = ~Don't you believe that there is always another morning?~
@1567 = ~You sound as if you know something I do not.~
@1568 = ~No. My heart tells me that we are nearing the completion of your quest. Tomorrow is uncertain.~
@1569 = ~Gavin, it's late. I'm tired. We both know tomorrow will come. Can't we talk then?~
@1570 = ~Because there is so much we haven't said, so much we haven't done. I regret nothing, with you, but if there was one thing I could alter, it would be that I would rather face the uncertainty of tomorrow as your husband.~
@1571 = ~There is still time to be married before we have to face whatever the fates have in store for us.~
@1572 = ~You were the one that wanted to wait.~
@1573 = ~I am still certain that we will live to be wed properly.~
@1574 = ~Why does it matter? You will face tomorrow as my betrothed, and that is nearly the same.~
@1575 = ~I am no longer certain that I wish to marry you.~
@1576 = ~We must, but there is so much we haven't said, so much we haven't done. I regret nothing, with you, but if there was one thing I could alter, it would be that I would rather face the uncertainty of tomorrow as your husband.~
@1577 = ~I do believe that, but I am not sure that we will see it. Your quest is a dangerous one, but I feel it is nearing its end.~
@1578 = ~ The only thing that worries me is that there is so much we haven't said, so much we haven't done. I regret nothing, with you, but if there was one thing I could alter, it would be that I would rather face the uncertainty of tomorrow as your husband.~
@1579 = ~There is nothing I know that you do not, but there is not much I do believe in with absolute certainty these days.~
@1580 = ~Tomorrow will come, but I am not sure that we will see it. Your quest is a dangerous one, but I feel it is nearing its end.~
@1581 = ~Not enough time, no. Were we to go to the Song of the Morning tomorrow, and demand to be wed, my family would not be there, and Mornmaster Kelddath would question our haste.~
@1582 = ~But that does not mean that we cannot say the words ourselves, and repeat them when we can do so formally.~
@1583 = ~Are you proposing a sham marriage?~
@1584 = ~If it gives you comfort, I'll say the words.~
@1585 = ~That sounds like trickery.~
@1586 = ~What would that accomplish?~
@1587 = ~Even if it does not replace a formal ceremony, I would like that.~
@1588 = ~I do want to wait for the right time to utter our formal vows, but our fate is so uncertain that I crave something more.~
@1589 = ~I want to say the words ourselves, and repeat them when we can do so formally.~
@1590 = ~I hope we will live to utter our formal vows, but our fate is so uncertain that I crave something more, right now.~
@1591 = ~Nearly, but not quite. I hope we will live to utter our formal vows, but our fate is so uncertain that I crave something more, right now.~
@1592 = ~*voice breaking* REally? Now? Why?~
@1593 = ~Because I no longer love you.~
@1594 = ~Because I keep hearing "tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow" and always a string of excuses. I don't want to wait any more.~
@1595 = ~Because I can't help thinking that if it were meant to be, it would not be this difficult to get married.~
@1596 = ~Because I am too young to be wed.~
@1597 = ~Because I begin to think that it would be a mistake to waste my youth on wedded "bliss" when I could be experiencing more... experiences.~
@1598 = ~Because I begin to think that it would be a mistake to waste my youth and my beauty with only one man.~
@1599 = ~Because I do not want to die a virgin.~
@1600 = ~I just don't want to marry you. I don't need to explain it any clearer than that, do I?~
@1601 = ~Gods, no! I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body! What is more, I want to do so before my god!~
@1602 = ~Will you exchange vows with me now, in case something... happens?~
@1603 = ~I will.~
@1604 = ~No. I will wait.~
@1605 = ~I am not sure I want to marry you now.~
@1606 = ~*gentle smile* Thank you, love.~
@1607 = ~Let's assemble the party, then, to witness our vows.~
@1608 = ~I, Gavin Mor, stand before you. I give you all that I am, and all that I will ever be. I will love you, honor you, and cherish you all the days of my life. From this hour henceforth, I owe you all allegiance saving only that which I owe to Lathander and to my daughter Lanie. I make this vow to you without conditions or reservations, of my own free will. Although I will later repeat these oaths before witnesses, from this hour, I am your husband. Will you be my wife?~
@1609 = ~I cannot.~
@1610 = ~I wish we had someone to witness our vows, but they shall be no less binding even if Lathander is the only other one who hears them.~
@1611 = ~*voice breaking* Why... why would you say that *now*?~
@1612 = ~Because I think you are using this as a way to get me into your bed.~
@1613 = ~Because if something were to happen to either of us, I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body! I want to do so before my god, in a formal ceremony, but I want to be united with you now.~
@1614 = ~*gentle smile* Then I will say the words. Thank you, love.~
@1615 = ~You break my heart, but perhaps this was meant to be. I will carry my love for you to the grave, but I will no longer inflict it upon you.~
@1616 = ~Then don't wait another day! I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body! I want to do so before my god, in a formal ceremony, but I want to be united with you now.~
@1617 = ~Then marry me now! I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body! I want to do so before my god, in a formal ceremony, but I want to be united with you now.~
@1618 = ~Then I will wait. Rest, dear one, and know that I love you.~
@1619 = ~One is not enough?~
@1620 = ~No, Gavin, I want more. Can't you understand that?~
@1621 = ~I haven't even known the touch of one man!~
@1622 = ~One was definitely not enough, by far.~
@1623 = ~Maybe it is. What do you intend?~
@1624 = ~I understand. It's selfish of me to want to keep it for myself. I release you from our promise.~
@1625 = ~I don't want you to, either! I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body! What is more, I want to do so before my god!~
@1626 = ~I intend to marry you! I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body! What is more, I want to do so before my god!~
@1627 = ~Then I will be patient. Rest, dear one, and know that I love you.~
@1628 = ~*Gavin embraces you, kissing you tenderly.*~
@1629 = ~Thank you for witnessing our vows.~
@1630 = ~Aw, how sweet! Good luck to you both!~
@1631 = ~About time!~
@1632 = ~Congratulations!~
@1633 = ~I wish you well, though I fear I have just witnessed the ultimate futility, as we undoubtably face disaster on the morrow.~
@1634 = ~Does an old heart good to see two true loves joined!~
@1635 = ~And I was hoping to play at your wedding! I suppose it can be cast into song later.~
@1636 = ~Hmf! You'd think you'd have the decency not to wake me unless it was something important.~
@1637 = ~Oh, this is so sweet. Too bad you didn't wait until you could have a big wedding, though. You should have had a nice dress, at least!~
@1638 = ~Haven't you enough useless things, <CHARNAME>? What do you need with one more?~
@1639 = ~I am pleased that you have made your vow before witnesses and your god. I wish you both well.~
@1640 = ~May the happiness of your marriage know no ending.~
@1641 = ~I wish thee the unspoiled joy of blissful marriage.~
@1642 = ~Ye got me up for this? Bah! I'm off t' bed!~
@1643 = ~Ooh, I love weddings! Too bad I get invited to so few...~
@1644 = ~Oh... *sniff*... I always cry at weddings! I'm very happy for you both!~
@1645 = ~May the gods bless your marriage.~
@1646 = ~Never saw much point in it myself, but good luck to you!~
@1647 = ~This looks exactly like a happy ending. Henali keep us vagabonds safe from them!~
@1648 = ~Why was not Tiax consulted?! Tiax did not give his consent!~
@1649 = ~<CHARNAME> gave hers, thank the gods!~
@1650 = ~I am so happy for both of you. Boo is happy, too, but he thinks we should go now.~
@1651 = ~I'd like to say the next part alone. Will you excuse us?~
@1652 = ~Aw...~
@1653 = ~Come, child, we're leaving now!~
@1654 = ~<CHARNAME>, my wife, will you let me love you as your husband?~
@1655 = ~Not until the formal ceremony.~
@1656 = ~*gulp* You cannot marry me now, or you cannot marry me ever?~
@1657 = ~Not now.~
@1658 = ~Not ever.~
@1659 = ~You do not need to lie with me, even if you do agree to hear my oath now! I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body, but I will wait for you! I want to do so before my god, in a formal ceremony, but I want to be united with you now.~
@1660 = ~Then let me say the words! I want to be married to you in mind, soul, and body! I want to do so before my god, in a formal ceremony, but I want to be united with you now.~
@1661 = ~I understand. It's selfish of me to want to keep you for myself. I release you from our promise.~
@1662 = ~Then let me love you as your husband, and chase away the emptiness of the night.~
@1663 = ~I will wait, my bride, but at least let me sleep beside you as your husband, and hold you close against the emptiness of the night.~
@1664 = ~*chuckles* As you wish, love. But let me hold you against the emptiness of the night.~
@1665 = ~Good morning, <CHARNAME> Mor.~
@1666 = ~*<CHARNAME> Mor*? I never said I would take your name!~
@1667 = ~Good morning, Gavin of Candlekeep!~
@1668 = ~Were you serious about that whole marriage thing?~
@1669 = ~That sounds dreadful, you know.~
@1670 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@1671 = ~No, you didn't. Don't you want to?~
@1672 = ~Not really. I have nothing against it, but it isn't mine. I'm still <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, but I'm married to Gavin Mor.~
@1673 = ~It sounds dreadful.~
@1674 = ~Are we really married?~
@1675 = ~No, I like the name well enough. It just startled me.~
@1676 = ~If only it were so! I would have loved to have known you throughout my life. Alas, I will never be Gavin of Candlekeep, unless we make our home there someday. You, however, may call yourself <CHARNAME> Mor now, or at any time you choose.~
@1677 = ~I don't know if I want to. I have nothing against it, but it isn't mine. I'm still <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, but I'm married to Gavin Mor.~
@1678 = ~We swore an oath. We are married. Like any oath, it can be broken, should one of us prove false, but Lathander heard us, even if no one else did. Do you regret it now?~
@1679 = ~No, do you?~
@1680 = ~Only a little. I thought it was just a bit of neediness on your part. I didn't realize you were serious.~
@1681 = ~I didn't think you were serious! I'm not ready to be married!~
@1682 = ~I'm glad we didn't wait.~
@1683 = ~Oh. Sorry. Well, you don't have to use my name if you don't want to.~
@1684 = ~I can live with it if you can.~
@1685 = ~I think I'll stick with <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@1686 = ~Would you be insulted if I didn't take your name?~
@1687 = ~I am glad you like it, beloved. You wouldn't have to take my name, but I am pleased you would choose to do so.~
@1688 = ~I cannot even tell you how happy I am to be your husband. My fondest wish has come true! I'll be even happier once we can repeat our vows before another priest of Lathander and *our* family, for it is yours now, too, but I can be content for now knowing that we are wed.~
@1689 = ~Of course not!~
@1690 = ~Well, I was. I hope you are content enough to have me. You can always back out. I do not own you. But I feel myself bound by our vow.~
@1691 = ~Well, I was serious, if you were not. I consider myself bound by our vow. Are you telling me you do not wish to be married to me?~
@1692 = ~No, I want to be married to you. I guess I'm still in shock.~
@1693 = ~Yes, I am telling you that.~
@1694 = ~Can you even know how overjoyed I am to hear you say that?~
@1695 = ~Then I will be thankful for that. You wouldn't have to take my name, but I am pleased you would choose to do so.~
@1696 = ~That is your choice, and I certainly don't blame you. The important thing is that we are married.~
@1697 = ~Of course not! That would be your choice, and I certainly don't blame you. The important thing is that we are married.~
@1698 = ~Then we'll just give it time to sink in. We have time, but I'm happy we're getting used to it now.~
@1699 = ~You break my heart, but I have no choice. I would not so easily abandon a solemn vow, but I would not hold you against your will. I release you from our promise.~
@1700 = ~It's going to happen soon, you know.~
@1701 = ~What is?~
@1702 = ~Whatever happened to my lover with the sunny disposition?~
@1703 = ~So we had better get ready for it, whatever it is.~
@1704 = ~This isn't a good time for a chat. Is this something iminent, or just a vague foreboding?~
@1705 = ~Whatever it is, we're as ready as we'll ever be.~
@1706 = ~Do you remember, not long ago, how I woke feeling like the world was holding its breath? Well, it's about to exhale, and we're going to be caught in the maelstrom.~
@1707 = ~Aren't you a right little ray of sunshine!~
@1708 = ~Are you afraid?~
@1709 = ~*You'll* be all right. Your mood is too heavy to move.~
@1710 = ~Is there something more we should be doing to prepare for it?~
@1711 = ~I'm sorry, dear one. I can't bring myself to act cheerful right now, even for your sake. Do you remember, not long ago, how I woke feeling like the world was holding its breath? Well, it's about to exhale, and we're going to be caught in the maelstrom.~
@1712 = ~I don't really know if we *can* prepare for it. Do you remember, not long ago, how I woke feeling like the world was holding its breath? Well, it's about to exhale, and we're going to be caught in the maelstrom.~
@1713 = ~Still undirected, but becoming more focused. I guess there's no sense talking about it, as there's nothing we can do but wait.~
@1714 = ~If we both make it through this, I'll be as sunny as you like. I'll even dance for you, if it makes you happy.~
@1715 = ~But pay me no heed. I don't see what we can do that we aren't already doing.~
@1716 = ~So why do you sound like a man in a wicker hut preparing for a tempest?~
@1717 = ~You've said it before: we're a resourceful lot. We'll manage.~
@1718 = ~So let's pretend it's over already.~
@1719 = ~So what should we do? Lie down and die?~
@1720 = ~Terrified, but I don't see what we can do that we aren't already doing to prepare for it.~
@1721 = ~Good! Then I shall cling to you with all my might, and anchor us both!~
@1722 = ~It's as good a plan as anything else. I don't see what we can do that we aren't already doing.~
@1723 = ~I don't see how there could be. We're' already doing all we can.~
@1724 = ~That isn't so bad, then. At least the man in the hut has more shelter than the man in the open field.~
@1725 = ~In any case, I just wanted to reaffirm my pledge to see this through. No matter what happens, I will not fail you. My love for you binds me to your cause as firmly as my sworn word.~
@1726 = ~*smile* I suppose we will, at that! In any case, I just wanted to reaffirm my pledge to see this through. No matter what happens, I will not fail you. My love for you binds me to your cause as firmly as my sworn word.~
@1727 = ~The gods did not make us to be that lucky. In any case, I just wanted to reaffirm my pledge to see this through. No matter what happens, I will not fail you. My love for you binds me to your cause as firmly as my sworn word.~
@1728 = ~Never! We all have to face our fears, love, not surrender to them. But death may find us anyway. I am not afraid.~
@1729 = ~Somewhere down here, there is a man who wants to kill you. Are you ready?~
@1730 = ~As ready as I can be.~
@1731 = ~You aren't leaving *now* are you?~
@1732 = ~Good. I'll be beside you until the very end.~
@1733 = ~I wish it was over.~
@1734 = ~Actually, I thought I might send you to scout ahead.~
@1735 = ~Let's hope that won't be today.~
@1736 = ~You'd better get ready, then. We're out of time. I want you to know that I'll be beside you until the very end.~
@1737 = ~That's the best anyone could say. I want you to know that I'll be beside you until the very end.~
@1738 = ~Gods, no! I'll be beside you until the very end.~
@1739 = ~I am honored to have served you, my captain and my queen.~
@1740 = ~When this is over, if I survive, I'm going to go back to Beregost to get Lanie. I'm going to have to take some coin to pay for her schooling. I'll make good time on the way there, but I'll have my daughter with me, so the return will be slower. Once Sarevok is dead, Baldur's Gate will be safe enough. Would you wait here for me, at the Elfsong? I should not be gone longer than a week.~
@1741 = ~I'm going back to Candlekeep. You can find me there.~
@1742 = ~Why can't I go with you?~
@1743 = ~It might be more fun for you to try to find me somewhere. I don't think I'll tell you where.~
@1744 = ~It will be over soon enough, one way or the other.~
@1745 = ~When this is over, if I survive, I'm going to go back to Beregost to get Lanie. I'm going to have to take some coin to pay for her schooling. I'll make good time on the way there, but I'll have my daughter with me, so the return will be slower.~
@1746 = ~Once Sarevok is dead, Baldur's Gate will be safe enough. Would you wait here for me, at the Elfsong? I should not be gone longer than a week.~
@1747 = ~Ha! You are a better leader than that!~
@1748 = ~Naturally. I am honored to have served you, my captain and my queen.~
@1749 = ~Thank you, my love. Onward to face your destiny!~
@1750 = ~Fair enough, but make it two weeks, then. I can't just drop her off at school and leave immediately, even if I will miss you. But that lies beyond a very uncertain future. Onward to face your destiny!~
@1751 = ~Lanie doesn't know about you yet. I was hoping to get her used to the idea in stages, before she meets you. Never fear, you will meet her. I won't be parted from either of you again.~
@1752 = ~Onward to face your destiny!~
@1753 = ~If you like, but I might have to call in a few favors to get one of the temple diviners to help me. Never fear, beloved, I will find you.~
@1754 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you remember when I joined this party, and you promised you would fight the evils of this land? There is so much more we could be doing. I have faith in you. I know you are a good person, and you have the potential to be a great person indeed.~
@1755 = ~It is not that I no longer believe in you or our cause. I do. But we must strive to improve our reputation.~
@1756 = ~<CHARNAME>, we have spoken of this before, and you know how I feel about good works. I believe you can be a good person, but your reputation is still less than I would have expected for someone with your potential.~
@1757 = ~It is not that I will no longer support you. I will. But I begin to question your leadership, and that makes me very uncomfortable. We must improve our reputation.~
@1758 = ~When I joined you, you said you would fight the forces of evil, but we are not perceived as a force of goodness. In fact, our reputation is far below what I would have expected, given your promises.~
@1759 = ~I do not believe you plan to change your ways. I have lost faith in your leadership ability and I no longer trust you to do the right thing. I am sorry, but our relationship is over.~
@1760 = ~<CHARNAME>, when I met you, I was struck by your beauty and your charm, and for a while, I thought that we had common values.~
@1761 = ~Alas, I think I was mistaken. I no longer believe we have much in common at all. I had hoped that we might continue to get to know one another and grow closer, but I begin to think that we could never be more than friends to each other.~
@1762 = ~It seems you are quite popular. It's entirely understandable, of course, but it makes me a bit uncomfortable.~
@1763 = ~It seems I am not the only man that finds you intriguing. I understand the reason for the attraction, but I must admit, it makes me feel a bit inadequate.~
@1764 = ~<CHARNAME>, I must speak with you. I know you receive a lot of male attention, and that you seem to enjoy it. I do not blame you, nor do I blame anyone but myself for my own... lack. You are entirely desirable, and deserve to be recognized as such.~
@1765 = ~But I have never had an excess of self-confidence. I am afraid that I am not going to be able to go on indefinitely as one of many suitors.~
@1766 = ~<CHARNAME>, can we talk?~
@1767 = ~Of course. What is on your mind?~
@1768 = ~Let me guess what you are going to say.~
@1769 = ~There is nothing to talk about.~
@1770 = ~I begin to fear that you will never shut up.~
@1771 = ~It's about the attention you receive...~
@1772 = ~Stop right there! You have no right to say who is or is not worthy of my attention.~
@1773 = ~You've commented on this before. This must really bother you.~
@1774 = ~Your insecurity is not very attractive, you know.~
@1775 = ~I know it makes you uncomfortable. I'm sorry you feel that way.~
@1776 = ~I know it's hard, but please don't let it bother you. You have nothing to fear from it.~
@1777 = ~No need. It is over between us. I simply cannot take the competition. I am sorry.~
@1778 = ~It has waited far too long already. I fear that if I don't get this off my chest, it will be over between us.~
@1779 = ~I didn't know there was anything between us to *be* over.~
@1780 = ~Do you mean that you expected something more out of this than the opportunity to worship me?~
@1781 = ~Oh, it's been over. You just don't know it yet.~
@1782 = ~All this drama is really just too much. Unburden yourself if you must, but keep it short.~
@1783 = ~I'm listening.~
@1784 = ~In that case, you had better speak your mind.~
@1785 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. I thought you liked the thrill of the chase.~
@1786 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. I must be blind to have missed seeing your discomfort.~
@1787 = ~All right, go ahead.~
@1788 = ~You are in love with me.~
@1789 = ~You have to leave.~
@1790 = ~You are jealous.~
@1791 = ~You are secretly in love with Shar-Teel.~
@1792 = ~You are secretly in love with Ajantis.~
@1793 = ~You are going to tell me it's over between us.~
@1794 = ~I would not be too sure about that. There is something weighing heavily on my heart.~
@1795 = ~Oh gods. Not another confession.~
@1796 = ~This isn't the best time for this.~
@1797 = ~Let me guess.~
@1798 = ~All this drama is really too much. Unburden yourself if you must, but keep it short.~
@1799 = ~I will, starting now. It is over between us.~
@1800 = ~That's what I wanted to talk about. <CHARNAME>, it's clear that I am not the only one who finds you attractive. And it is just as clear that I am not close enough to your heart for me to want to prolong the pain I am feeling. I have to accept the fact that you do not love me. I need to let you go. I am sorry.~
@1801 = ~Is that really how you feel?~
@1802 = ~No, Gavin. I'm sorry. I should not have snapped at you like that.~
@1803 = ~Sometimes. You do talk a lot.~
@1804 = ~Yes. You really do talk too much.~
@1805 = ~I know. That is why it is over between us.~
@1806 = ~I know. I'm not even sure you think I am worthy of it. That is what we need to talk about. Can you give me one good reason why I should continue to pursue you?~
@1807 = ~Because I love you. Or I might, if I get a little longer to let the feeling grow.~
@1808 = ~Can you bear it just a little longer? I need just a little more time to make up my mind.~
@1809 = ~Because I am beautiful?~
@1810 = ~Because I am no less choosy than you are.~
@1811 = ~I've been wondering why you do myself.~
@1812 = ~Because I need more time to think about my feelings for you.~
@1813 = ~I know. That is what we need to talk about. This uncertainty is really hard on me. I need a reason to keep pursuing you. Can you give me one?~
@1814 = ~It does, but you haven't done anything to alleviate my fears. I need a reason to keep pursuing you. Can you give me one?~
@1815 = ~Maybe that would explain why you seem to care so little for me.~
@1816 = ~Well, seeing as how you feel, I guess it will come as no surprise to you that I wish to end our relationship.~
@1817 = ~So I gathered. Do you want me to continue to pursue you or not?~
@1818 = ~Of course I do! I'm quite fond of you, really.~
@1819 = ~Yes, I do.~
@1820 = ~I wish you'd leave me alone.~
@1821 = ~Sorry. I can't help it. But it does make me wonder. Do you even want me to conitnue to pursue you?~
@1822 = ~Do you plan to do anything to ease this feeling? At this point, I'd like some encouragement to keep pursuing you.~
@1823 = ~I'm quite fond of you, really.~
@1824 = ~I just need a little more time.~
@1825 = ~You pursue me of your own free will. I do not ask for it.~
@1826 = ~That's good to know.~
@1827 = ~Apparently not.~
@1828 = ~I worship Lathander. If you expect that kind of veneration from me, I am afraid that I would never cease to disappoint you. I'll save us both the trouble, and let you go now.~
@1829 = ~And now I do.~
@1830 = ~No need. It is over. I just can't take the competition.~
@1831 = ~<CHARNAME>, you know I am not the most confident of men. This will come as no surprise to you. You are a beautiful woman, and so utterly desirable that a man would have to be mad to refuse the honor of courting you.~
@1832 = ~If there is something wrong here, it is something wrong with me. I am simply not brave enough to be one of many suitors. Fear of rejection is driving me mad.~
@1833 = ~I have reached the point that, without encouragement, I must let you go.~
@1834 = ~Oh well. It was fun while it lasted.~
@1835 = ~If you are going to be so insecure, we have no future, anyway.~
@1836 = ~This is rather sudden. Can I have more time to make up my mind?~
@1837 = ~Trust me, Gavin, you have nothing to fear.~
@1838 = ~I am sorry this has been so hard on you, Gavin. I am actually quite fond of you.~
@1839 = ~I've never liked hunting.~
@1840 = ~Thank you. This might not be as difficult as I had feared.~
@1841 = ~Well, that is rather ominous.~
@1842 = ~Maybe I could have been, but I feel like I am pursuing you to no good end. I will not go where I am not wanted, so I must let you go.~
@1843 = ~I think you might be pushing me too far away to see if that is true.~
@1844 = ~*draws breath, pauses, and lets it out in a rush* That is beside the point.~
@1845 = ~Not exactly. I just need to know your mind.~
@1846 = ~*sigh* Yes, I am. I feel my own jealousy rise and threaten to choke me whenever I see another man pressing his suit with you.~
@1847 = ~Um, no. It is about this jealousy that rises up and threatens to choke me whenever I see another man pressing his suit with you.~
@1848 = ~Were he not another man, I might be, but since he is, I am not.~
@1849 = ~No, it is about this jealousy that rises up and threatens to choke me whenever I see another man pressing his suit with you.~
@1850 = ~Yes, I am. That was not as hard as I imagined it would be.~
@1851 = ~No, but that time is drawing nearer.~
@1852 = ~No, I would not wish that at all. It is about this jealousy that rises up and threatens to choke me whenever I see another man pressing his suit with you.~
@1853 = ~You might be lying, but I have to risk it.~
@1854 = ~*sigh* I feel this incredible jealousy rise up and threaten to choke me whenever I see another man pressing his suit with you.~
@1855 = ~Ah. Well, I shall be a good deal more quiet from now on.~
@1856 = ~I'm sure I've earned that. But still, I must speak.~
@1857 = ~Then I have just found a reason to talk to you a good deal less.~
@1858 = ~Er... in that case, take as long as you need. Sorry for being so difficult.~
@1859 = ~I can, but please don't leave me hanging forever.~
@1860 = ~There are many beautiful women that I will never have. You will just have to be among them.~
@1861 = ~I do not like the way you phrased that. You make it sound as if men were something you could pick out from a herd, like you were buying a horse.~
@1862 = ~You mean they aren't?~
@1863 = ~At least with horses, you can see what you are buying. I only want to be sure the man I choose is good enough for me.~
@1864 = ~That isn't the way I meant it. It is just that I see things to admire in more than one man, so it is... difficult.~
@1865 = ~Oh, that came out all wrong! It isn't like that, but I do need more time to think.~
@1866 = ~I shall not do it any more, then.~
@1867 = ~Very well.~
@1868 = ~Really? I'm... I... you... *ahem* Please, take all the time you need, then.~
@1869 = ~Then I will wait, but please do not make me wait too long.~
@1870 = ~Then I will stop trying. A bit of a relief, really.~
@1871 = ~I shall do as you say.~
@1872 = ~No, you do not. I should listen to you more.~
@1873 = ~Not for me, it wasn't.~
@1874 = ~You've had quite a while. I am out of time. I need to end this.~
@1875 = ~Very well, but please do not take too long.~
@1876 = ~I am so relieved to hear you say that!~
@1877 = ~Really? Well, that's a relief!~
@1878 = ~I suppose that would depend on whether you want anything other than a fast mount. I'll leave you to wrangle one in peace.~
@1879 = ~Usually, I find honesty attractive. Not now, however.~
@1880 = ~I cannot blame you, then. But please do not take forever.~
@1881 = ~Then take the time you need.~
@1882 = ~<CHARNAME>, we have spoken of this before. I am not going to tell you how to live your life, or whose attention to accept, but I cannot continue this way.~
@1883 = ~Believe me when I say that my affection for you is very real. If it were not, the attention you receive from others would not bother me. I know this is my problem, and not yours, but if you continue to accept the advances of other men, I will have no choice but to end our relationship.~
@1884 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am truly sorry, but I can not go on like this. I had hoped that you would be content with my devotion alone, but I was mistaken. I must end our relationship. Please understand that this decision is final.~
@1885 = ~I will continue to support you in your quest, but I am afraid I can only support you as a friend.~
@1886 = ~<CHARNAME>, I get the feeling that you have no interest in becoming any closer. I will not continue to annoy you with my endless chatter.~
@1887 = ~<CHARNAME>, communication is important. I would like to think that I would have been a good listener, but you do not seem to want to talk to me. Now there is nothing left for us to talk about.~
@1888 = ~<CHARNAME>, That is twice, now, that you have indicated that you do not wish to become any closer. The truth hurts, however I have no choice but to accept what you have told me, and take it to heart.~
@1889 = ~If that is your desire, I will comply with your request.~
@1890 = ~<CHARNAME>, you have deceived me.~
@1891 = ~Whatever can you mean?~
@1892 = ~If you were not so unreasonable, I would not have needed to do so.~
@1893 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. At first, I was just curious. I had no intention of letting it get this far.~
@1894 = ~And?~
@1895 = ~Did you really think I would never notice that you are, in fact, male?~
@1896 = ~I have nothing against men, but I don't want one for a lover. I hope I don't need to tell you that it's over.~
@1897 = ~I mean that you presented yourself to me as the embodiment of goodness, but I see that is not the truth.~
@1898 = ~Nay! I know you want to speak, but there is nothing you can say that will sway me. The heart is not ruled by logic. And my heart will never be given to someone who does not share a love for what is right as well as a love for each other.~
@1899 = ~You practice the foul art of necromancy. I am afraid that I cannot ignore this. Our relationship must end.~
@1900 = ~You kill other people for a living! I would not even befriend one who would do such a thing. Our relationship, and our friendship is over.~
@1901 = ~You claim bounties. You hunt other people as if they were prey. I am sorry, but I cannot condone that, nor can I welcome such a woman into my heart. I am sorry, but our relationship must end.~
@1902 = ~You presented yourself as much more wise in the ways of the world than you are. You might not have set out to deceive me, but deceive me you have, so I must end our relationship. I am sorry.~
@1903 = ~You presented yourself in a form I would find appealing, but you based that on a lie. I could never love and respect a woman who would lie to me like that.~
@1904 = ~The heart is not ruled by reason. And my heart will never be given to someone who would deliberately deceive me, for any reason. You knew who and what you are, and you knew I would not accept that, or you would not have lied. You should have been honest with me, even if it meant I might not love you.~
@1905 = ~But you did let it get this far. And now it can go no further. My heart will never be given to someone who would deliberately deceive me, for any reason. You knew who and what you are, and you knew I would not accept that, or you would not have lied. You should have been honest with me, even if it meant I might not love you.~
@1906 = ~And?! And you deliberately deceived me! My heart will never be given to someone who would lie to my face, for any reason. You knew who and what you are, and you knew I would not accept that, or you would not have lied. You should have been honest with me, even if it meant I might not love you.~
@1907 = ~<CHARNAME>, this revelation shocks me to the core. The power... the evil... that resides inside you, without you ever being aware of it, terrifies me. I am most sincerely sorry, but I must withdraw to think about this.~
@1908 = ~Will you join me?~
@1909 = ~I've changed my mind, Gavin. I'm not ready to let you sleep beside me, after all.~
@1910 = ~You swore you would abstain with a woman you had not *promised* to wed. Gavin, you have already promised to marry me, so you would not be breaking your oath if we became lovers.~
@1911 = ~I must! By Lathander's golden majesty, I hunger for you. I had thought myself strong enough to lie beside you and leave you unmolested, but I am weakening. I promised I would not lie with a woman I had not promised to wed...~
@1912 = ~But you *have* promised to wed me! We are engaged!~
@1913 = ~That is true, my love! I have promised to marry you. And you have consented to become my wife. Will you... Would you also consent to become my lover?~
@1914 = ~That's all right, love. I can wait until you are.~
@1915 = ~Now that the others are asleep, there was something you wished to discuss?~
@1916 = ~Yes. Gavin, can we talk about your... vow?~
@1917 = ~Gavin, I have been thinking about what you said. I would like to become lovers.~
@1918 = ~I changed my mind. I just want to sleep.~
@1919 = ~*smile* I've been thinking about it myself. I swore that I would become intimate with no woman I was not prepared to wed. But that no longer applies to us, my beloved wife-to-be.~
@1920 = ~No, it doesn't, my husband-to-be. You have already promised to wed me.~
@1921 = ~How so?~
@1922 = ~I have, and the thought of marrying you thrills me even more than your tender kisses, if such a thing were possible.~
@1923 = ~While I am no longer bound by my own oath, I am still bound by your wishes. Will you have me as your lover as well as your intended husband?~
@1924 = ~I want to wait.~
@1925 = ~Then let us learn the ways of lovers together.~
@1926 = ~Then I am content to wait, as well.~
@1927 = ~I have already promised to marry you, dear one, and the thought of marrying you thrills me even more than your tender kisses, if such a thing were possible.~
@1928 = ~But our promise to each other means that I am no longer bound by my own oath. However, I am still bound by your wishes. Will you have me as your lover as well as your intended husband?~
@1929 = ~*kissing you tenderly, but urgently* Then let us learn together the ways of lovers.~
@1930 = ~Then sleep well, my love, but I will collect a kiss for my pains in seeking you out!~
@1931 = ~*Most unusually, Gavin is still sleeping when you wake. His arms still encircle you, and his features are serene.*~
@1932 = ~<CHARNAME>... we should talk.~
@1933 = ~Are you up to it?~
@1934 = ~Yes, we should.~
@1935 = ~Gavin, are you going to be all right?~
@1936 = ~Why haven't you healed that yet?~
@1937 = ~I think so.~
@1938 = ~What do you want to talk about?~
@1939 = ~Gavin, I don't know what to say.~
@1940 = ~Did you really expect me to carry a severed finger around in my pack?~
@1941 = ~Gavin, I'm sorry.~
@1942 = ~I can't believe you can ask me that! I want to talk about what... happened. Has my sacrifice restored your trust in me?~
@1943 = ~Yes. Gavin, I am sorry you had to maim yourself to prove your devotion.~
@1944 = ~Yes, but do you really expect me to carry a severed finger around in my pack?~
@1945 = ~All you proved was that you are crazy enough to cut off your own finger.~
@1946 = ~Yes, without a doubt. But I am not sure I want someone to love me *that* much.~
@1947 = ~*smiles* Then it was all worthwhile.~
@1948 = ~That is what you wanted, wasn't it? No matter. Now that it is no longer... attached, I can probably scrape the finger out with the tip of a knife.~
@1949 = ~If I gave you the finger back, would you be able to heal it back on?~
@1950 = ~Thanks. I would appreciate that.~
@1951 = ~No, Gavin. I need the reminder of the lenghths you would go to for my sake. I'm sorry I put you through that.~
@1952 = ~I would have needed to have advanced far further in Lathander's service for him to have granted me that spell. Once part of the body is severed, it requires a restoration spell. Even had I the power, I would never use it for something as trivial as a finger. Well, not my own, anyway. It's my shield-arm, and I can use ordinary healing to close the wound.~
@1953 = ~Once again, the choice is yours. Shall I try to remove that which offends you?~
@1954 = ~I would appreciate it.~
@1955 = ~Now the only question that remains is whether or not my injury has restored your trust in me.~
@1956 = ~As you wish.~
@1957 = ~Then it was not worth it. I would not have an unwilling bride. I release you from our engagement. You may keep the ring as a reminder, or throw it away, whichever pleases you. I'll carry my own momento of this sad tale for the rest of my days.~
@1958 = ~You deserve no less. I cannot make myself stop loving you. If you would rather I did not show it, then tell me, but not today. I've been through enough for one <DAYNIGHT>.~
@1959 = ~Then let me speak. I need to know if my... injury has restored your trust in me?~
@1960 = ~That is what you wanted, wasn't it? No matter. Now that it is no longer... attached, I can probably scrape the finger out with the tip of a knife. I need to know: has my sacrifice restored your trust in me?~
@1961 = ~I believe you, but I would appreciate it if you would scrape out the finger.~
@1962 = ~Leave the ring alone. I need the reminder of the lenghths you would go to for my sake. It has restored my trust in you, and I'm sorry I put you through it.~
@1963 = ~So am I, but I want to talk about what... happened. Has my sacrifice restored your trust in me?~
@1964 = ~In time, but I want to talk about what... happened. Has my sacrifice restored your trust in me?~
@1965 = ~I haven't been able to bring myself to do it yet. I will, but I want to talk about what... happened. Has my sacrifice restored your trust in me?~
@1966 = ~Was that more to your liking?~
@1967 = ~Mmmm. Yes, it was. Maybe you just needed some practice.~
@1968 = ~Gods, yes!~
@1969 = ~Not really, but I suppose I must endure it.~
@1970 = ~That was no better. Gavin, I never want to do that with you again.~
@1971 = ~Thank the gods you are a patient woman! I love you to the point of pain, <CHARNAME>, and I would hate to think that you would not be able to enjoy something so intimate.~
@1972 = ~Oh, sweet <CHARNAME>, I would hope you would never have to endure anything for my sake. Perhaps all you need is a little more time. Nevertheless, I shall wait for you to tell me if you want to try again.~
@1973 = ~If it isn't too inconvenient, do you think we might be able to spend a couple days off in the woods somewhere, sometime soon? I have a sudden desire to feel the breeze on my face, and to have birdsong in my ears.~
@1974 = ~This isn't the best time for a field trip.~
@1975 = ~We just got back to civilization, and you want to leave again?~
@1976 = ~Believe me, Gavin, there's nothing I'd like more than to feel the wind on my face, too, but we have to get out of here first.~
@1977 = ~That sounds like a good idea. We'll do that as soon as we can.~
@1978 = ~Chasing butterflies, Gavin?~
@1979 = ~There is no rush. Whenever your plans will allow it is fine with me.~
@1980 = ~Thank you. I'm looking forward to it.~
@1981 = ~Maybe. I do like being outside in the fresh air, though.~
@1982 = ~I wonder if we might be able to spend a night at an inn sometime soon. I know we've a job to do, but I can't help thinking we'd all be better after a night in a real bed.~
@1983 = ~We don't really have time for a side trip, Gavin.~
@1984 = ~I thought you liked the fresh air!~
@1985 = ~Believe me, Gavin, there's nothing I'd like more than to sleep in a real bed, but we have to get out of here first.~
@1986 = ~Getting old, Gavin?~
@1987 = ~Thank you. I can't wait.~
@1988 = ~Maybe, but mostly, I just want the chance for a good, long bath. I miss getting properly clean.~
@1989 = ~I wonder if we might be able to go into town shortly? I've run out of some medicines, and you know I'm no herbalist. I'll never be able to tell the bindweed from the arrow-leaf.~
@1990 = ~We don't really have time for a shopping trip, Gavin.~
@1991 = ~We just left town, Gavin! You might have said something before we left.~
@1992 = ~Believe me, Gavin, there's nothing I'd like more than to go herb shopping, but we have to get out of here first.~
@1993 = ~What would make you think of herbs now?~
@1994 = ~There is no rush, but do try not to need any poultices until we have time to restock.~
@1995 = ~Thank you. I appreciate your forebearance.~
@1996 = ~I just cut myself accidentally, and it reminded me that we were low on some of the better poultice herbs.~
@1997 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you think we might be able to step outside and get a bit of air?~
@1998 = ~Can this wait?~
@1999 = ~I'd love to, but we have to get out of here first.~
@2000 = ~Are you feeling all right?~
@2001 = ~Ah, well, as soon as it's convenient, then. No hurry.~
@2002 = ~Thank you. I appreciate your consideration.~
@2003 = ~Yes, thanks, but I'd still like to get outside for a minute.~
@2004 = ~<CHARNAME>,...~
@2005 = ~You are a talkative one, aren't you?~
@2006 = ~Sorry, Gavin, but I haven't got time for this now.~
@2007 = ~I was just admiring the sunlight on your hair. The way the light catches, it looks like it's shot with golden threads... But I should not be so forward.~
@2008 = ~Thanks...~
@2009 = ~No, Gavin, you haven't said anything offensive.~
@2010 = ~What do you seek to gain by flattering me?~
@2011 = ~You shouldn't waste your time on such idle chatter.~
@2012 = ~Eh? No, I was just admiring the sunlight on your hair. The way the light catches, it looks like it's shot with golden threads... But I should not be so forward.~
@2013 = ~You are right. You should not.~
@2014 = ~Maybe. I was just admiring the sunlight on your hair. The way the light catches, it looks like it's shot with golden threads... But I should not be so forward.~
@2015 = ~As you say. It wasn't really important.~
@2016 = ~I apologize if I have offended you.~
@2017 = ~You haven't. I was just a little startled. I'm not used to compliments.~
@2018 = ~It isn't that...~
@2019 = ~Gavin, why are you paying me so much attention?~
@2020 = ~Well, don't stop! I think it's sweet.~
@2021 = ~That's a relief! I wouldn't want to offend you. Your... good opinion is important to me.~
@2022 = ~I do have to tell you that I am not much used to compliments.~
@2023 = ~Then you can compliment me any time. I think it's sweet.~
@2024 = ~Gain? Nothing... I do not mean to flatter you. I sought only to compliment you. Your... good opinion is important to me.~
@2025 = ~I should have known that my clumsy compliments would be offensive to a lady of your quality. I did not want to offend you. Your... good opinion is important to me.~
@2026 = ~I apologize for... offending you.~
@2027 = ~You are forgiven, but you should know that I have little patience for idle talk.~
@2028 = ~That is unfortunate. Were you jaded to them, you might coax some eloquence out of this sorry excuse of a cleric.~
@2029 = ~Not every human male finds me or my kind attractive.~
@2030 = ~We can pretend that I've heard it all, if you like. I wouldn't want to discourage your muse.~
@2031 = ~I have heard about your kind before.~
@2032 = ~Well, thanks for the compliment, but we really should be getting back to our task.~
@2033 = ~Is it... because of your heritage?~
@2034 = ~See! Even you can only see me as a half-orc, never as just a woman! How can I believe your sincerity?~
@2035 = ~No, Gavin, it is because I do not entirely trust your motives. A man may compliment a woman for his own reasons.~
@2036 = ~There are some that think a half-orc is an easy conquest.~
@2037 = ~No! You haven't offended me! You just startled me! I had not expected you to wax poetic.~
@2038 = ~Because you are beautiful and mysterious. I'd put it all in eloquent verse, but I'm no poet.~
@2039 = ~Well don't stop now! I wouldn't want to discourage your muse.~
@2040 = ~I'm afraid I have to. I've run out of things to say. Were I a poet, I'd record your beauty in verse, but it's all I can do to coax that much eloquence out of this sorry excuse for a cleric.~
@2041 = ~Ah. On we go, then.~
@2042 = ~Your kind? Well, yes, I suppose there are men who prefer the company of other men to even the loveliest women, but I'm not like that.~
@2043 = ~Or do you refer to... your heritage?~
@2044 = ~No! You just took me by surprise. I had not expected you to wax poetic.~
@2045 = ~I am afraid that my muse has fled. Not out of fear of starvation, though. The sparkle of your eyes and the glow of your skin would have fed it long indeed. But I talk too much. I must save something for another day.~
@2046 = ~My kind? What would that be?~
@2047 = ~Those that would use sweet words to further their own ambitions.~
@2048 = ~Those that consider a half-orc to be an easy conquest.~
@2049 = ~Those that cover their own insecurity with bold words.~
@2050 = ~Those that babble on to no good purpose.~
@2051 = ~Why don't you tell me what you are getting at.~
@2052 = ~I... don't know what to say. I know you do have orcish blood, so I will not pretend that you do not. But that has not made you unlovely to me. Quite the reverse. The physical strength you inherited as part of that legacy attracts me, and it is pointless to deny it. Likewise, it would be folly to claim that I do not find your features exotic.~
@2053 = ~In you, I see the truth of Lathander's teachings. The blending of races *is* desirable, for the offspring of the union can combine the best of both.~
@2054 = ~But then I hate myself, because to admit that I am drawn to the beauty of your form is to deny that I am inspired by the beauty of your soul. Anyone can see the former, but I am still becoming acquainted with the latter.~
@2055 = ~So please forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I talk too much.~
@2056 = ~I will not attempt to deny that I do serve my own interests, but they are not as base as you might imply. You are a woman of quality, and it would be an honor to be held in your good opinion.~
@2057 = ~But I talk too much, when we have many cares.~
@2058 = ~Conquest?! Gods, that you should think so little of me! I would not wish to conquer any woman, least of all one whose good opinion I would cherish.~
@2059 = ~As for your... heritage, I don't know what to say. I know you do have orcish blood, so I will not pretend that you do not. But that has not made you unlovely to me, or cheapened you in any way. Quite the reverse. The physical strength you inherited as part of that legacy attracts me, and it is pointless to deny it. Likewise, it would be folly to claim that I do not find your features exotic.~
@2060 = ~I expected it no more than you. I've certainly never been any good at it before. But forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I talk too much, and we have many cares.~
@2061 = ~Well, then, that's a first! Usually, I cover my insecurity with more stammering. But forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I talk too much, and we have many cares.~
@2062 = ~Ah, yes. Well, it would seem you have heard of my kind, then. But forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I talk too much, and we have many cares.~
@2063 = ~Getting at? Nothing! I saw the sun on your hair, and it was lovely. I hope I have not offended you with my careless remark, but if I have, it would be me all over. But forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I talk too much, and we have many cares.~
@2064 = ~You haven't. I was just a little startled. I'm not used to compliments from big people.~
@2065 = ~I do have to tell you that I am not much used to compliments from big people.~
@2066 = ~Is it... because you're a halfling?~
@2067 = ~See! Even you can only see me as a halfling, never as just a woman! How can I believe your sincerity?~
@2068 = ~There are some that sweet talk halfling girls because they know there's no danger of commitment.~
@2069 = ~Or do you refer to... your stature?~
@2070 = ~Those that that sweet talk halfling girls because they know there's no danger of commitment.~
@2071 = ~I... don't know what to say. You are a halfling. But that has not made you unlovely to me. Quite the reverse. The wit and grace you inherited as part of that legacy attracts me, and it is pointless to deny it. Likewise, it would be folly to claim that I do not find your features exotic.~
@2072 = ~In you, I see the truth of Lathander's teachings. There *is* beauty to be found in all the races, if only a man can look beyond his own reflection to see it.~
@2073 = ~Sweet talk? <CHARNAME>, I don't say this to seduce you! I would not treat any woman like that, least of all one whose good opinion I would cherish.~
@2074 = ~As for your... stature, I don't know what to say. You are a halfling. But that has not made you unlovely to me, or cheapened you in any way. Quite the reverse. The wit and grace you inherited as part of that legacy attracts me, and it is pointless to deny it. Likewise, it would be folly to claim that I do not find your features exotic.~
@2075 = ~<CHARNAME>, um, you were planning on getting that removed soon, weren't you?~
@2076 = ~Why, Gavin? Don't you think I look good as a man?~
@2077 = ~I thought I might leave it a while. See if it grows on me.~
@2078 = ~I suppose. Does it make you uncomfortable?~
@2079 = ~Yes, definitely!~
@2080 = ~You do, but you looked better as a woman.~
@2081 = ~Er, yes, if you say so. I do not think it will have that effect on me, however.~
@2082 = ~A bit, yes.~
@2083 = ~Thank Lathander! No offense, <CHARNAME>, if I liked men, I'd find you irresistable, but I really think of you more as a woman.~
@2084 = ~Ah! That is so much better!~
