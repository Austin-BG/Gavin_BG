Reed says you're thinking about getting married! Good news! I've been wed to your mother nigh on forty years, and never regretted a day of it. Son, you're old enough by now to know what you want, and wise enough by now to know why you want it, so just bring your girl home and let us welcome her to the family.

With love,
Dad

Hello, Gavin!

About time you settled down! All I can do is agree with Dad. Married life has been good to me, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

If you've ever thought about making a more permanent home, we could sure use you here. Dad's still working in the shop, but he's getting older, and some of the bigger pieces are starting to give him trouble. And Lanie would have a chance to get to know her cousins.

But that's all talk. You do what you want, and I can't wait to meet your lady. I hope she says yes!

Your brother,
Gordon

Dear Gavin,

I hope that by the time you're reading this, congratulations are in order!

Dad and Gordon said it all really. I am sure she's a lovely person, and I can't wait to meet her. But this does remind me that I really should say something about herb-lore. Try putting a juniper berry in with the cassil herb. It doesn't do anything, but it lets you know when you've steeped it long enough. You don't want any more accidents!

Love,
Della

- - - - - - - - - - - -

Dear Gavin,

Don't you pay any attention to Della! Your father and I only want you to be happy, and if you've found a woman that does that, you bring her home, and we'll treat her like one of our own. And I wouldn't say don't give us any more grandchildren!

Wishing you and your (hopefully!) wife-to-be every happiness,
Love,
Mum

Hello, Gavin -

Sorry about the subterfuge, but I know you'd never spend money on your own wishes, what with one thing and another. Still, every lady deserves an engagement ring as unique as she is. I hope it suits. I did the charm on it. It offers protection, but I didn't add any "surprises," this time.

Hope this letter finds you a happily engaged man. I am looking forward to getting to know your soon-to-be bride!

Best wishes,
Reed~

A local thief named Penny has provided us with information regarding the disappearances that have been plaguing Beregost.

We have performed a valuable service for Beregost. The town had been plagued by an evil, if pitiable, necromancer named Lady Valeria. She had been unsuccessfully attempting to extract the happiness of her victims and distill it into an elixir that would somehow fill the emptiness in her own life. Maybe if she'd made a few friends, instead, things might have ended differently for her. Before she died, she thanked us for freeing her. Regardless, our efforts have been well rewarded.~
